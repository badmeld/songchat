[ Omarion ]

Even though you're all alone,
All alone and I am gone.
I just want to keep you warm,
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

Yes I'll be back again
Yes I'll be there.

Cause when I'm all alone,
I think about your face.
And I how I want to touch it,
but you're so far away. [I'm So]

All I want to do is,
give you all of me now.

Are you ready,
Are you ready. [ Yeah, Yeah]


[Drake]

Oh Oh-

I'm aware that we just met,
But I don't want to leave you yet.
Promise that I won't forget,
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

Yes I'll be there, oh,
Yes I'll be there, oh.

About to board the flight,
sitting at my gate.

And I just want to touch you,
but I'm so far away. [I'm So]

All I want to do is,
give you all of me now.

Are you ready,
Are you ready. [Oh, Oh]
