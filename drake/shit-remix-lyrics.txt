Talking 'bout you popping tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talking bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fvck shit

Took niggas from the hood like I'm from there
So you know it's all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there nigga
But I had to come through for the remix
On my haven't done a verse in 8 weeks shit
And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don't feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don't know, but they should know
Yeah, I just think it's funny how they dangling the bait
But I'm the one that's killing niggas on the hooks though
And niggas ain't got a grill, still ice grill hating
I know y'all already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at the numbers, nigga, I feel amazing
I call Michael Jordan up and Mike will make it
I'm the young rap nigga with the mega deal
You need to come to OVO for a better deal
Just know a million ain't shit once you get a mill
Nigga nah, fuck that, this year I'm talking big stuff
Rolling through the city like a young nigga bricked up
Fvck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That's why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up

If money talk then your pockets ain't saying shit
I'm in the bathroom getting head from your bitch
And I ain't paying her shit
You want beef? You don't know who you playing with
I tell my pilot to land the jet
I'm hopping off, get 'em, we popping off
Give a click and you niggas dead where you standing at
I'm just a trippy nigga smoking on cabbage
Your money funny like Jim Carrey
I got bitches that's super bad like Halle
And we still keeping that white like Barry
I'm a rich nigga, still keep a pistol with me
Nigga you ain't fuckin' with a picture of me
I got all this cake and shooters with me
Just in case you pussy niggas try to get you a piece
What it is, my nigga? What it's hittin' for?
Where the car you were whippin' in the video?
Where is the ice at? Where is them pretty hoes?
You a fraud, real niggas already know
Broke ass niggas I can't stand them
I hit 'em with the cannon
I buying out the mall at random
Juicy J that nigga is fresh to death
Smoke till there is nothing left
Bail off and then I'm ghost in my Phantom

Nigga tell me how you want it with a savage
It get crazy where I'm living it's tragic
If you can take it from my pocket you can have it
You know I got a body bag in the trash
You know I got an old thot you can have
Nigga come fuck my old bitch
Niggas couldn't eat my old pussy
I'm in the kitchen I could tell you how the stove looking
Nigga all I really wanted was the pyrex
A couple hundred body snatchers in the projects
You know my bloods stay connected like direct
I'm in Miami my bitches like "where Lebron at?"
I finish fucking her [?] like "where your mom at?"
In front the coppers I got choppers for the combat
Couldn't believe it my niggas say he was sellin' grenades
Keep bullshittin' and ima sit you where the bomb at
D.C. nigga, sittin wrist dip low
He ain't know a chopper price get this low
See I cop em' in Atlanta bring em' back to Alabama Avenue
And tell them niggas "come and get it let's go"
Fifty in the Mac take em' back to Benning Road
Strippa bitches in my kitchen with the semi's on the floor
All I know I want him dead by tonight
With his head in his lap and his body at the light
Purchase me some [?] and I'm a buy some Sprite
Tell a bitch keep counting till she get the count right
When a bitch finish might purchase her a flight
Might take her whole life
Might fuck her all night
Right, you know I hate to say it twice
But you pussy ass niggas ain't bout that life
Pussy ass niggas ain't bout that life
Pussy ass niggas ain't bout that life

My killas got shooters on shooters Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang
Knock em down hundred rounds, lotta pounds, kilograms on the ave
How you want it? Quarter thang, half thang, whole slab?
Young Atlanta nigga pull a hammer on ya
Pull up on a nigga in a California
Teach a lame how to flip a couple numbers
Whole summer dope runners getting more commers
Money got me geekin', damn I need more
Alejandro bringin' in them truckloads
Copy that, get racks, nigga ten-four
Choppa bullets just rip a nigga head off
Clip long as a little nigga leg dawg
Empty that and the barrel just smoke
Closed casket, nigga head open
Peel the top back, yeah I'm in the foreign
Wide body and it sittin' on Forgies
Choppa kick like Chuck Norris
Ralph Lauren, my engine full of horses
Aim game insane nigga I'm a marksman
Cocaine white y'all niggas flip porcelain
Blow worth a fortune, million on the fortress
Niggas totin' AK's like they Glock 40's

Thirty in the clip catch the whole thing
Feds know a nigga by his whole name
Shoot him in his head for his gold chain
You was running ball, we was sellin' cocaine
Talkin bout you buyin' bricks, nigga you ain't got shit
We was sellin' all them keys, we was like the locksmith
Twenty-Five hundred for the red bottoms
Prolly make five bands for the waste nigga
I'm rollin' through my city in a new Rolls Royce
Cheif Keef 300 for the Wraith nigga
A.K, S.K, H.K nigga, three K's like I hate niggas
And I'll put you in your place nigga
You got shoebox money I got a safe nigga holdup

Automatic pistol on a nigga leather seat
See a bad bitch she my jam of the week
All I ever wanted was a kilo
Till they end my little war with the Regal
Bitches lookin' at me, Keisha look at all this change
It's the heart of war tour bus full of K's
Master P money I could pull up in a tank
C Murda shooter know a pill on the way
Still [?]
Rich niggas coming through you broke niggas better move
At your front door got word you got work
3.5 for the [?]
Now six figures for the set niggas verse
All eyes on me as I'm walking through the church
Prayin' lord forgive me, 30 shots in the semi
I done payed all of my ties now it's time to go and get it
My new plug don't fuck with the kuh
My new bitch gettin' fucked in the butt
Ridin' by the [?] see me sitting in the trunk
Niggas say they coming threw but they see me strapped up, what
Nigga runnin' in your house for the brown bag
Fear wanna know how much in the brown bag
Nigga swinging that stick for the brown bag
Your bitch even saw my number on the brown bag
All I ever wanted was a Kilo
Till they end my little war with the Regal
Sippin' on purp niggas still got a plan
Still movin' work work nigga ooh what a night
Ooh what a night, ooh what a night
If it was a picture of that pussy it'd get 200 likes
Get 200 likes, all that bitch gettin' from me is 200 likes
