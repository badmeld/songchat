Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut it's you I'm thinking of

But how we move from A to B it can't be up to me
'Cause you don't know who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing so I just ignore you, yeah, oh

But you're on my mind
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, oh
But maybe in time
In time, in time, I'll tell you I'm

A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you

I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first to say it
But still I, they know, ah, ah, ah

I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you know, baby
I love you, love you a little bit

You would do it, you would say it
You would mean it then we could do it
It was you and I and not only I

Think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in la, la, la, love with me

I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go

So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson

The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just so wrong

I wonder where my world 'bout
Where niggas that I know tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous 'cause you always get approached more

Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah, tell her all that, that

And as for you I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably

A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
