More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)
Girl, we should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)

OVO I ride, OMO I ride
Reps Up, them my niggas from the Scarborough side
Don't fuck with them, or hollow tips will fly
I don't have to lie
Lot of people say it in a song just to say it, man, I'm not that type of guy
Hit me on the cell
I just might bring you to the city, send you home with stories you can never tell
I'm tryna break you out of your shell (And what?)
You just turned 21 like Adele, that's good with me
I put my business on hold, let me turn off the phone
Let's explore the unknown
If you not drinking with me you force me to turn up alone
No peer pressure, I just know you like to get in your zone
You say that you'd rather smoke

Well, let me call up OB's room and tell â€˜em roll up a cone

I know he probably got that extra special
I never second guess it
How's Villanova? What classes you taking next semester?
Man, she like "fuck the small talk"
I'm not here to discuss extra credits or my professors
No time for funny stories
It's funny how she shows up late, but always comes before me
We both young and misguided but thats another story
