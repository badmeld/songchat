I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive

Don't worry about me & who I fire
I get what I desire
It's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire

In this very moment I'm king
In this very moment I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring
and I will retire with the crown, Yes
no I'm not lucky I'm blessed, Yes
clap for the heavyweight champ, Me
but I couldn't do it all alone, We
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
cuz I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Aint being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of
P-p-p-p-put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they could think of
Gr-Greatness is what we on the brink of

[Chorus]
I wish that I could have this moment 4 life, 4 life, 4 life
In this moment, i just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment 4 life, 4 life, 4 life ( I could have this moment x3)
This is my moment, I just feel so alive ( I could have this moment x3)

[Drake]
Yeah

Yeah
Yeah, ugh
What I tell em hoes bow bow bow to me, drop down to ya knees
Young Money the Mafia that's word to Lil Cease
I'm in The Dominican Big Papi Ortiz
Doin' target practice all these bitches just aiming to please
Shoutout to the CEO 500 degrees
Shoutout to the OVO, Red Wings and fatigues, oooow
Niggas wanna be friends how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year we ain't get the memo
A young King, pay me in gold
Forty got a bunch of weed he ain't even rolled
These niggas be droppin songs they ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga aint even home, yet!
Yeah, be very afraid these other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin can catch a bouquet, ooooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes, you and all them white girls party of five
Are we drinking a lil more I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man!
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is, cause everybody dies but not everybody lives, Ahhh

[Chorus]

This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away I'm
One with the sunset
I have become alive
I wish that I can have this moment 4 life, 4 life, 4 life
Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive

I wish that I could have this moment 4 life, 4 life, 4 life
In this moment, i just feel so alive, alive, alive
