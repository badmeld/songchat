You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah, I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Yeah, well, alright, here I go

My hollow from the heart is hard to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Aloha's to women with no ties, to men that I know well
That way there are no lies

You could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas

It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got the resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up
And we just wanna party, patron straight up

Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
O-V-O clique, Red Wing Boot gang
Yeah, we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who'd thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic

I could relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time that your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike but gotta A-I him for your survival

Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
'Cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
Yeah, so on behalf of the demanded
And the entertainment that you take for granted
You could thank me now

And oh, my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I'm trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
'Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from

But drink up because everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
Yeah, that's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around

You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah, I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now

Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it
'Cause me dedicating my time, just isn't realistic

Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me

But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump latte's and low fat muffin's, do I?
Or is missing what we had, outta the question
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson

I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe's who's there before it all
I guess that's how it goes, they hear about your cons
Or focus on your pro's and love you for who you are
From the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow

Into women that are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allow, where are they all now
I know there somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud

Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
And tell me I'm the highest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key

It's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it

I'm sorry, poolside drinking, margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down

I'm in the world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position

You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah, I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
It's okay
