Makin' believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
But I'll always dream, still I'll never own you
Makin' believe, it's all I can do

Can't hold you close, when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Makin' believe, I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you, making believe

Makin' believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours I find are so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Makin' believe what else can I do

Can't hold you close, when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe, I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you, making believe
