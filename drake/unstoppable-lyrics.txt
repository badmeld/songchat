My name is Drizzy and I ain't perfect
But I work hard so I deserve it
And I belong right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mister Fenny, na

I got a descent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
And I fall in love with girl caught up and superficial glamor
Who dress like Sara Jessica and live like princess Diana

So often they have addiction and I'm the one who will feed it
But truly you bad enough that you don't really even need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids

Of you and your possie partying, drinking what you get handed
With your virgin island tans, all looking like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehending
But these girls are having fun
With whoever's money they spending, screaming

I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay, ay, ay, you don't like
Ay, ay, ay, you don't like

I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay, ay, ay, you don't like
Ay, ay, ay, you don't like

My name is Whezzy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard working
Bizarre circus, that's what my bars surface, therefore I act the clown
Even when I laying on my back I'm never backing down

So over stand me, I got a condo in Miami
And my door mat is always sandy and I run Louisiana
But I've never pulled a hemi and I got a condo in Atlanta
And I always wear a bandany

And when it come down to stunning you boys are just fronting
And I swaging for the fence
Your girl hanging from my dick
Your girl singing to my shit like, "A li, li, lollipop"

She say I get that pussy wetter than a designer shop
And she say I pick that pussy better than her gynecologist
Hold this, text me whenever you want some more dick, more dick
Old bitch, young bitch but I be like, damn, all I got is one dick

I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay, ay, ay, you don't like
Ay, ay, ay, you don't like

I got the talk, the beats and bass
Give me one I'll take it, make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace
I break it, break it, you can't stop me in this ra-race

I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay, ay, ay, you don't like
Ay, ay, ay, you don't like

I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay, ay, ay, you don't like
Ay, ay, ay, you don't like
