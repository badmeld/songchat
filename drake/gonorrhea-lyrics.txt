with a windshield full of tickets cuz I live right by the station
I aaaaam, tryna figure out why you so mad at me
yes I?m with Young Money tell the magazine stop asking me
I be with the dread with the tattoo?s on his head
and a flag the colour red like a f-cking low battery (ok)
n-gga peep the sh-t I?m wylin? on
I be with your baby momma, you be with your child at home
Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of styrofoam
big cheese big bread call that sh-t a calzone
I will break your f-cking collar bone
us against the World better pick which side you on
Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady putting mileage on
and we about to kill em C4 Mr Carters home.

(Chorus)
