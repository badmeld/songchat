Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know

This is really one of my dumbest flows ever, I haven't slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I'm single, thinking about what we had and missing you
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too

I mean paparazzi on me, tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby, don't hold on too long 'cause that's how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me, eat your motherfucking heart out

It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can't escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave
But still spending every dollar they encourage me to save

But I'm good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgetting from where I came
And no matter where I'm headed, I promise to stay the same

I'm just riding 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I'm the realest nigga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking 'bout the greatest

I just really hope that you'll think of me
I just really hope that you'll think of me
I just really hope that you'll think of me
'Cause I'm tryin' to be unforgettable
(I'm doin' my thing, I'm doin' my thing, I'm doin' my thing)

This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life, y'all say forever
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest you're gonna get to this is a 'Pac t-shirt

The name's Young, baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I'm gonna need a thug wife
Yeah, I'm talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm

Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I'm talking Caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers

You say you sit in them streets, so what's the deal?
Young done everything in the A but fuck chillin'
So welcome to my life, no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her name's the game

I'm just riding 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I'm the realest nigga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking 'bout the greatest

I just really hope that you'll think of me
I just really hope that you'll think of me
I just really hope that you'll think of me
'Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable
(I'm doin' my thing, I'm doin' my thing, I'm doin' my thing)

Got my top dropped on this beautiful night
It's a beautiful night to live my beautiful life
The pain hurts like the cut from my beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife

Yeah, Drizz and me got a little breath
Unforgettable, ya never forget this
You understand me? Timeless, homie
Unforgettable

Let me know, let me know
