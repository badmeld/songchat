Junior high, played them High school, played them ...College well, you know... played them Me and my friends use to laugh about it, how we fade 'em Now Cupid is aiming his arrow right there at me No more nonchalence can I be, with you here starring at me With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever seen You pull an emotional vibe from my Soul, look at me You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries.

[Chorus]

For the first time Im in love, And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody, what i'm feeling For the first time I feel love And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody the feel...

All them men before me did shit I would never do And I know you got your guards up, but they should let him through Just keep fightin' for our lovin' baby, I'll defend it too And if they try and tell me time is money I'd spend it with you I spend it all I spend it all I charge forever, to my card And pay it off, no interest lost I be right here, and like your favorite wine girl, I'm worth trying, but take it easy on me Cuz this my first time courtesy OriginaLyric.Info [Chorus]

For the first time Im in love, And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody what i'm feeling For the first time I feel love And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody the feeling

[Sean Garrett]

I ain't never looked into a woman's eye worth of fire Bet I'm feelin while you holdin' me begging to take you higher For so long I wasn't faded, I couldn't admitted before But now I see what life's about, and i'm never goin' let you go Girl I'm growin' (don't wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable) I see us growing, Don't wanna miss out on a feeling I never had before

I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know What you'da done to me, I gotta let'em know

For the first time Im in love, And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody what i'm feeling For the first time I feel love And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody the feeling
