I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it, right there, that's it, do it just like that

Only you could do it just like that and I love it when your hair's still wet
'Cause you just took a shower
Runnin' on the treadmill and only eatin' salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college

Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard knowin' you
Weekend in Miami tryin' to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Mighta been a time when I loved her too

But you take that away and you always been the one, one
I wonder why the moon looks nice girl
Maybe it's just right for the night used to niggas comin' on too strong girl
They want you in they life as a wife

That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wanna fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run e'rything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard but girl you got it
Girl you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they lookin' at you
Everywhere you go?

Wonderin' what's on yo' mind
It must be hard to be that fine
When all these mothafuckers wanna waste yo' time
It's just amazin' girl

And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you

Everything's addin' up
You've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck
And you

Bet, bet, bet, bet, bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, babblin'
But I never mention everything I dabble in

And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row your boat
It's Pink Friday Records and O.V.O.

Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It's Mac, OPI and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominatin' every avenue

Cobblestone, good view, lil' gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I fl-fl-fly, I'm flyin' high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch

And baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
Be a million, billion
Trillion miles away, oh

He, he, he, he, he asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star, sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guarded?
Double D up hoes, Dolly Parton

I know things get hard but girl you got it
Girl you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they lookin' at you
Everywhere you go?

Wonderin' what's on yo' mind
It must be hard to be that fine
When all these muh'fuckers wanna waste yo' time
It's just amazin' girl

And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you

That's why you're bad as fuck
And you know you are

And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so
I'm so proud of you

Everything's addin' up
You've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck
And you know you are
