Tat my name on you girl so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real

[Hook: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup

[Verse 3]
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for 1 more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side effects I'm sure
Went from driving up on some old shit, to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something just ask for it's yours
Yea, ask for it's yours, if you ask for it it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they're all playing their role, Put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my sect
I give everybody a piece of this, and I make due what's left
Yea I do this shit to the death, yea I do this shit till I'm gone
Yea, I told you that it's our world, and you're foolish thinking I'm wrong
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel, tat my fucking name on you, let these niggas know it's real, wassup

[Hook]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup
