Hello muthafucka, hey, hi, how you, doin'?
It's Weezy F baby, comin' to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy-ass niggas
Stompin' on this beat like a motherfuckin' sigma

Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out

You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' a clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard

Bitch, I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard

First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Makin' hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business so button up your shirt straight

Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doin' me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage

Blowin' purple clouds, nigga, I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it movin' like a drive-by

I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm going in and buckin' when the hook drop

I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard

Bitch, I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard

Hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenant
If I said I'm going in, then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club, then Imma motherfuckin' spend it

Cost a few hundred Bens and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah, you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' winnin'
She said, "I seen it all",  I said, "No, you fuckin' didn't"

You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said, "I can't feel my legs", I'm like, "Bitch, me neither"
I'm going in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends

And Imma be a legend even when my life ends
And Imma a be a legend even when this life ends
Girl, I do my thang, hop up on it, like, bem!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them

I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard

Bitch, I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard
