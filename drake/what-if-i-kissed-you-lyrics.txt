[Drake:]
What if I kissed you right now*
How would you explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don't really care who knows it
Can you afford to be open with all these emotions
If you were a secret how long could you keep it

Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
[? ]
And you just be mine
And you just be mine
And you just be mine (just, just, just be mine)

What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off of our shoulders
Tell on me
I don't mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie...
