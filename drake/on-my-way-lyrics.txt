Drake:
The clock that you've been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait (What kind of man does that to a girl he loves)
If you just give tonight to me, I promise
My hands will say ,they'll say
Less than a minute, Take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Cause even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy Ohhh,
Think about the last time i came through 
I had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only f*ck you like that on your birthday

Hook:
Baby I just landed 
Bout to get my bags and
All I need's an address and i'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes i see you calling me
Promise its worth waiting for
Cause i'm on my way

James Fauntleroy:
Wont hurt its just some turbulence were dropping
Don't be a afraid Ohhh 
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
Ill keep you safe,So safe
