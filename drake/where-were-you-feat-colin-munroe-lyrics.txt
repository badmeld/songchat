[Verse 1: ~Drake~]
Took if from signing my own yearbook to booked for the year*
Got a condo and I couldn't even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to T S sex
To people wondering if it's the phantom he gets next
Who knows, it's the rabbit it's buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin he's feeling
And it's kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasn't really around when it wasn't appealing
Now it's denim[? ] and diamonds an' perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in
(I love the [? ] with the rims to match)
What girl that wasn't me who's verse you saying
Shâ€”t I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other n-ggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I don't forget the past
And you gave me nothing so I'm gonna give you nothing right back, like...

[Chorus:]
[Colin Munroe:]
Where were you when I...
[Drake:]
Would'a loved the person you trying to be now
It's funny I'm the dude you dying to see now
[Colin Munroe:]
Where were you when I...
[Drake:]
... was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
[Colin Munroe:]
Where were you when I was...

[Verse 2: ~Drake~]
Young, dumb,
Looking in the mirror trying to figure out who I'm gonna be this year
It's funny you managed to be around for the present
All puns intended your funds are mended
If I take back the cheddar it's better for both us
No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a car from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this ain't Hollywood squares to me
Sweetie I'm far from a Hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if it's not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasn't in it, fine
But don't try to get a start at the finish line
Ah,

[Repeat Chorus:]
