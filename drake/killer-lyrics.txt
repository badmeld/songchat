Uh
Uh huh, uh huh
Look

(Drake: Verse 1)
I let the beat bang
I don't claim colors
Honestly, the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter
But when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi Coast
Couple days on the beach
Then its adiï¿½s
(Killa)
Just look at what I done alone
You would swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees, no honeycomb
And you could probably feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
Drizzy

(Drake chorus)
Uh
I'm tryina bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a mufuckin
Killa
Killa
Killa
Killa
Uh
And I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around
Shit'll never be the same
I'm a.
Killa
Killa
(Look)
Killa
Killa nigga
(Listen, look)

(Nipsey Hussle Verse 2)
Before rap,
My last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success
It look like right now
What was once gray skies
Is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones y'all said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps
And you see what I'm bout
I keep my money comin' in
And never goin' out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammers out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bunk you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over-shine
Been fuck bitches
I been on my grind
'Cuz on a mission your worst enemy is idle time
Hussle

(Drake chorus)
I'm tryina bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a mufuckin'

Now that I'm around
Shit'll never be the same
