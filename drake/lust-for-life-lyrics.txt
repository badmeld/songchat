I'm tryin' do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryin' to shoot down my flight before it lands
Before it lands

But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back
I really wish y'all will fall back
But gettin' rich suppose to solve that

And these days women make offers
And who the hell am I to say no, no, no?
My ex send late night text
'Cause she don't know how to let go, go, go

She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models
Standin' in the cold, aw yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see every time that I'm here
But when am I really even here?

Black suburban with the tent on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'ma be the one to pour cement on it

Uh, and start over and show up in an Mars yellow tux
I don't really give a fuck and we only getting older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
It's funny when you coming in first but you hope that you last
You just hope that it lasts

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her, oh, oh
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up
