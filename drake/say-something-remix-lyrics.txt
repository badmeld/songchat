[** feat. Timbaland, Lupe Fiasco:]


[Hook: ~Drake~]
This shit was all I know*
You and me only,
And I did it all for you,
Still you were lonely,
We coulda worked it out,
Uhh, but I guess things change,
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain,
When ya no longer involved that person has it all,
And you just stuck standing there,

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby,
Say something baby,
Say something baby,
I'm gonna need you to say something baby,
Say something baby
Say something baby

[Verse 1:]
Secretly I'm a menace to society
They just see me as a generous man rioting
No one depends on this, but they say it quietly
I hate not being the nemesis so violently
What am I tryin to be, guess it's a blinding feat
Guess I'm too blind to see, why she is cryin to me
These verses don't have much to do with the chorus
I know it's catchy but the meaning just ignore it
Anyways back to my thesaurus
If I ever make it I'm a put her in the forest
But first she needs to accept what I'm pourin
Otherwise I don't have time to be endorsin
Til that time I'm gon be reinforcin (what I'm feelin)
Wonder whatll happen when I pop the question
I give her the time when she want attention
Giver her the space even if I need someone to listen
Won't know what to do when my (most important fan is missin)

[Verse 2:]
Agreeing with Drake, I guess things change
Wonderin if my fantasy success brings pain
But in reality I'm a mess these days
So please help me with the blessing rain
All I need from you is to listen
If you hear me out I've completed my mission
I'm a need her to say something
Cause all I hear is nothing, n she ain't fronting
Maybe I'm too cunning, thinkin too much into it
Got to remember she on that independent shit
But I got a leave a message, cause I act too reckless
N she deserve better then a necklace
So ey girl come check this
You the one who kept it real
You the one who slept with appeal
N I'm the one whos trapped on what I feel
Like I said til the time I'm a sign off but not on a deal
