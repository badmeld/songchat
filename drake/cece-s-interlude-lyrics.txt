[Drake: {*singing*}]
All night I've been staring*
Can you tell I want you
Can't be too wide open
There's nothing I won't do
Ohhhh
Just thought you should now
Cause when you start to laugh
Oooo oh, oooo oh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Oooo oh, oooo oh
You won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
This is serious

Uhh, I wish I wasn't famous
I wish I was still in school
So that I can have you in my dorm room
How I put it on you, crazy
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Oh ooooh, oh oooooh
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
This is serious
