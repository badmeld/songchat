Take your nose off my keyboard
What you botherin' me for
There's a room full of niggas
What you followin' me for

This ain't no fuckin' sing-along
So girl, what you singin' for
It's 'cause we blowin' like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4

Twenty, keep the bar rollin'
Fake ID's and the trash we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign

Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of cash comes straight from Poland

Why, 'cause they lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew, they lovin' the crew
Oh, they lovin' the crew, oh, they lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew, they lovin' the crew, they lovin' the crew, whoa hoo

Yeah, smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

And really, I think I like who I'm becomin'
There's times where I might just do it just to do it like it's nothin'
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces

All it took was patience, I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story then made history

Tell 'em I'ma need reservations for twenty
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everythin' you believe in, I know

C-c-crew, oh, you're lovin' the crew
Oh, you're lovin' the crew, you're lovin' the crew, oh
Oh, you're lovin' the crew, they lovin' the crew, they lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew, whoa hoo

'Cause we blowin' like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
So broadcast that, nigga, we the news in your city
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa hoo
