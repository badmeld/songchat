I heard that your settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
It ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the lie
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said:
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
You'd know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summery haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over yet
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said:
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remembered you said:
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
