Yeah,
I had to do this shit for my little brother Mar
Young nigga just wanna hear me talk that Toronto shit, you know?

You see bad bitches and fall in love
I be talking arithmetic in the club
Re-negotiations
Young Frank I seen all of your favorite girls naked
Mental pictures were taken I never forget they faces
Theyre lucky I cant draw, but still Im artistic
Money on the way Its got both of my palms itching
You boys in the wrong business. For real
You boys in the wrong business
All this sitting back and watching will make you a strong witness
Testify on how Im living
Make sure its non-fiction
Don't leave out anybody that put me in this position
We couldn't have done it better
We changed this city forever
Puffin shisha
Lay back fucking with FIFA
What I get for the feature I wouldnt fuck with me either for real
Now Im in it for the hoes and the checks
Care less about respect from niggas I never met
