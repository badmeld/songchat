Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow?
Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago

Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I 'em hear talkin'
I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me
I'm slowly embracing it

Doesn't come natural
Bear wit' me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racin' with
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it
Wayne put me right here
That's who I get the paper wit'

I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is somethin' I would die for
October's Own, but it's lookin' like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before, but won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks,
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks

All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like oh-ah-oh-oh

I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me
Who coulda predicted Lucky Strike will have you stuck with me
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily

What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
And you makin' it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious

There was smoke in the air before now it's me clearin' it
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it comin' you just get to see it go
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes
Fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before, but won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

Everything the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learned to deal with it

For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city I let her explore
And now she's sayin' she more lonely than every before

How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flyin' back home for the heritage classic
Searchin' for that feelin', tell me where is the magic?

Let's stay together till we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
Yhat's why I'm really goin' off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before, but won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
