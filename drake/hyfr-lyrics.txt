Ah, all my exes live in Texas
Like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State
Where tuition is handled

By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited

I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'

And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after textin' and told her I'm faded

She asked what have I learned since gettin' richer
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' wit' you

Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past, there's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all

Yeah, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressin' room, confusin' me with questions like

Do you love this shit, are you high right now
Do you ever get nervous, are you single
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true, you gettin' money
You think them niggas you with is with you

And I say, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air
So I hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle

My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night

After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessin' and started undressin'
And ask me to hold her and so I did but that was last month
And now she's textin' me, askin' for closure

Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married

Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusin' me with questions like

Do you love this shit, are you high right now
Do you ever get nervous, are you single
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true, you gettin' money
You think them niggas you with is with you

And I say, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright, uh

And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright, oh yeah

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
