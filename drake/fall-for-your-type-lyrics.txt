Can I, Can I
Save you from you
Cause you know theres something missing
And that champagne you've been sipping
Not supposed to make you different all the time

Its starting to feel
Like the wrong thing to do, yea
Cause with all that recognition
It gets hard for you to listen
To the things that i must say
To make you mine

But live Girl
Have some fun girl
We'll be fine

Trying to convince myself
I Found one
Making the mistake i never learn from

I swear I always fall for your type, yea
For your type

Tell me why I always fall for your type,
For your type

I just cant explain this shit at all x5

I believe in people like you
