Check!
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
my verses smother pizza and they are in need of some lipo
as for rappers, she is not my type, she’s like a typo
flow is universal, take a blood test, I’m type O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it’s quite low
alright so, I might blow, my chain ?
see life is a scrimmager I am running the ice so
what is about to unfold, don’t tell ‘er like a dice throw
meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
its only if she’s nice though, I ain’t about the wife though
and let know, Uncle Ben’s rice throw, that is just how my life go

and move faster than the leopard sprint
around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
but I’d rather go deaf than lose touch
holla at me baby

[Chorus]
look,
been a minute, I know my number outta service
cuz sometimes I don’t really wanna be reached
damn now things change in a year
tell me how everything go
and I know someone told me you wanted to teach
lemme give you my (new sh-t)
now lemme give you my (new sh-t)(x6)
then call me anytime, I’ll bet you I’ll be around, ’round

[Drake][Verse 2]
since you came into college, hill is somethin you still tebow
then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
or maybe DMP, A Tribe Called Quest
but when you call too much then I call less
you would always complain about my small texts
but what you call conversation I call stress
and that put a barrier between both of our carriers
and I would be like “I ain’t getting service in your area”
you be like “n-gga get your balls up”
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
you took out those extensions and lost you a lil weight
your booty lookin bigger and I think that sh-t is great
a fresh start is in order, lemme take you on a date
take you on a date, I used to think you used to play too much
but I’d rather go deaf than lose touch
holla at me baby! (look)
