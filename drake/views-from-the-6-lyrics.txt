You must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no, no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you with Jen and Melissa
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy, young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
It's some views from the 6
Just some views from the 6
Views from the 6,
A couple views from the six
One time for my nigga Tracy Drake
Knew the shit when happen, yo Im sorry for the way
A couple niggas from the six
That shit aint happened by mistake
The shit aint happened by mistake
No, I bet you probably not use to me
A real nigga that will tell you how it is, how I live
You can really get use to it
Ive been working, Ive been doing shit,
Really Ive been takin trips all across the States
Always on the road like I dont got a place to stay
Getting money like I try to gettin out the way
Boy Im getting to it fast then Im jumping on the plane
And Ill be gone
Everybody want me back but they dont love me back home til Im coming back home
Til I say that Im the bro
To my city that Ive been, Ive been fuck around with ery body
Cuz I wont fuck with anybody,
lately they been talking by the young nigga
Ive been a kid with a .
But I aint pass with my paper nigga
Dont fuck that, fuck your life
Get your money right before my shit is over price nigga
Yax, really real, truly true
Im getting over paper cuz this issue is overdue
This the view nigga, sit back
Views from the six
