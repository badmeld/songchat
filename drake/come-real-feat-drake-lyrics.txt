I always wonder why you bother putting make up on
you dont need it
and even though i always tell you that you're beautiful
i repeat it
cause i dont want no singer i dont want no model
and i dont want no fashion designer or nothin
i just want your love i'm telling you thats more than enough for me
all you gotta do is come real shawty whats the deal
don't think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
i wouldnt have it any other way ay ay ayyyy
all you gotta do is come real shawty whats the deal
don't think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
i wouldnt have it any other way ay ay ayyyy
i know it 1 am but girl can i come over
she asked me if i'm sober, stop playing with me
you know i'm never sober and i'm already approaching
she try to say it be better if i leave baby please
i'm already down the street know you weren't expecting me
Oh you must think you look a mess
but i don't really think i could care bout nothin less
i just got to your address, i'm out the car and i am coming up the steps
she complain she dont want me to see her in her sweatpants
fk that st i just wanna work them sweat glands
beat it up beast like, muntant shit, x men
plus i already said i prefer you with no make up
made her face go down now her face stuck
made her pop a bean just to stay up
baby you so thick
you so fine, spongebob all on her pyjamas
now take that st off
so you can get this hammer
come real shawty whats the deal
don't think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
i wouldnt have it any other way ay ay ayyyy
heavy amounts of kush whenever that we chill
i know you like to look good but i like you better real
it's whatever though if thats how you feel
we can get it crackin tell me whats the deal
all that superficial st i dont need that
i like you just how you are dont make me repeat that
she said dont worry bout it and just to lean back
woo woo girl what you a beast at
her last nigga Z decieved her in her lane
J comes in to relieve her of her pain
cause i can stick it down like a needle in the flame
and then i go to work like a beaver in the rain
chase specialises in rekindling the flame
chase so good she catch a fever from the game
i just take over the delusions on her brain
take my pistol out and i just let it bang
come real shawty whats the deal
don't think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
i wouldnt have it any other way ay ay ayyyy
come real shawty whats the deal
don't think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
i wouldnt have it any other way ay ay ayyyy
