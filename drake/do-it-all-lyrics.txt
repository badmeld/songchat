[Chorus:]
Somebody remind me where I am*
That's right I'm at home, I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking that it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Hook:]
And I'm a do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'm a do it all
I'm a do it all
I'm a do it all
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tonight I'm into breaking up
Somebody's home
I'm drunk as ever
I'm not alone, I'm with my people
I know you love it
[? ]
I over does it
I be getting money so long
It's just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you might just get it all
Now my life is angel [? ] Pinot Grigio
Baby forget about it
I'm headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it
My judgements never clouded
That's why I'm steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I'm about whatever man
I'm tryna fuck with tinkerbell in never neverland
But I'm polite about it
Baby after you
I've had a glass or too so somebody remind me where I am

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Tryna get the green like I'm waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where'd I just put my bow tie
Millionnaire multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess thta parts a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask what's up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, I've been down and I got up

Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love should'nthappen
Becuase everythings easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I'm still the mafia, still run the commitee
NY forever nigga, Diddy,

[Chorus]

[Hook]
