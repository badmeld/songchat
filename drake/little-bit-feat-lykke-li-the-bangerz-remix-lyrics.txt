[Lykke Li:]
Hands down
I'm too proud, for love
But with eyes shut
it's you I'm thinking of

[Drake:]
But how we move from A to B
it can't be up to me
Cause you don't know
Who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just
ignore you, yeah Oh oho
But you're on my mind, my mind,
my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh oho
But maybe in time, in time, in time
I'll tell you I'm a

[Chorus:]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit,
a little bit,
a little bit in
love with you Oh oho

[Drake:]
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first,
to say it
But still I, they know I ah ah ah

[Lykke Li:]
I would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
Cause your my baby I
love you love you
A little bit

You would do it
you'd say it
you'd mean it
And we coud do it
It was you and I and only I
Ha hm

I think I'm a little bit
Little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit, little bit
In lalalala love with me

[Drake:]
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
you can teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson

The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both N'Sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but
it's just soo wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
Where niggas said I know,
tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well tell her fall back
caught up in some more shit tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't
cheating on her ass
With a girl that I know
yeah tell her all that, that
And as for you I think I
know your the one
The closest I've come
I'm probably...

A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you Oh oho
Lalalala love with me
Oh oho, oh oh
