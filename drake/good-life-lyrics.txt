Beach front properties, panoramic views
You could probably catch him in Atlanta with his crew
Plus his whole vibe like candles and a pool
Cause he’s hot, but you notice how he handles it is cool
The name is Drake dawg, I came here solo
The smell is Dolce, the drawers is Polo
The DJs Future, the clothes is Ransom
The cut’s from J-Mac, ya boy is handsome
Pay me now, nigga cash advance him
Y’all don’t wanna see me throw no tantrum
We blowing up this year, it’s called expansion
Now everybody get to dancing to this, ah…..

[Hook]
I’m trying to make sure that you feel right
Cause you already know what it be like
Well dressed for the evening
Party hard like we ain’t leaving
Now let’s have a toast to the good life (Uh, huh)
Go ahead and keep drinks coming all night
Shoutout to the DJ, now please let me down here tonight
The way this make you feel, say oohhh
Tonight, the way
This make you feel, say oohhh
Toast to the good life…

[Verse 2: Rebstar]
My lawyer J-Money, but it’s not important
She seen the videos, but she don’t know my story
Army greens sneaks, homie GI Jordan
On another time zone, we party ’till the morning
My man looking up to me, he ’bout to sneeze
And she treating me like I be New Year’s Eve
