Yeah they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me

I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Guess I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't (yeah)
I feel good, sometimes I don't (ayy, don't)
I finessed down Weston Road (ayy, 'nessed)
Might go down a G.O.D. (yeah, wait)
I go hard on Southside G (yeah, wait)
I make sure that north-side eat
And still

Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me

Turn the 0-2 into the 0-3
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met the broski's
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own "aye, no"
Someone watching this s--t close "aye, close"

Might go down as G.O.D. "ohh, wait"
