Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it

Cap on, brim bent, Denzel every time
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cards saying fuck ya life

Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double

Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
But I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas

Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her imma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake

Bought the president the Louis presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain't talking about the peach state
Man for Pete's sake scratch that, sweepstakes

Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed

M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 though at the venue
Pop bottles with my team, Young Money till the death of me

I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas

I mean we don't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag
I mean, I mean but then again
Who looks at the price tag? You know.

Oh yeah, we in this bitch
Oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, we in this bitch
Oh, oh, oh

I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas

I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
