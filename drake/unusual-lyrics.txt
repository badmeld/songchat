Trey Songz Talking:

And I wouldn't be me if I didn't get a little nasty
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na (x3)

Verse 1:

How `bout we just move over, and just do it where we at
How `bout you just lift that skirt up
Ohh, we can be bad
That place that ain't been touched, I'm feeling on it
I'll let you sit through, keep spinning on it
Girl, giddy Up Giddy Up, take me on a ride to ecstasy

Bridge:

You don't wanna bump bump then take a nap
You just wanna bump bump bring right back
Watch me I'ma heat it up, beat it up
Ohhh

Chorus:

I know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not gon' do what the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual

Verse 2:

I wanna do the wicked things you never do
What if we get it while your friends was in the room
Is that too hot for ya ?
Don't you feel bad, let em feel sexy
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they ain't gotta know
No, Ohh
Watch me heat it up, Beat it up
Woo, Hey!
Do You hear me girl ?
Watch me heat it up, Beat it up
Woo

Chorus:

I know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not gon' do what the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual

Trey Songz Talking:

That's the run (Check)
Cinema (Check)
On the hood (Check)
Of The Car (Check)
On the top (Check)
On the beach

Drake:

This that other shit you know you ask for it
I might just save you some money, and getcha passport
So you can come to me city, I'll take you all over
And hit you on the balcony, just don't fall over
Send me a picture baby, you know I'd never leak it
I know you got something recent, for someone decent
Why you laughing out loud, I'm serious
Bring your girl if you a little bi-curious
Please ; Please no Storytelling of others
I promise you gon' love it, I would never let you down
Feel like I might of perfected, all the things that you've expected
And you gon' know it when you bring your ass around
Motherfu- Oh!

Chorus:

I know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not gon' do what the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual

Trey Songz:

Get it all different kind of ways
All different places
Look at the many little faces you making
But can you take it

Ohh

Y'all thought I was nasty last year
