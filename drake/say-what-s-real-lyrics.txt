Why do I feel so alone like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggas the cue to go

So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertaining as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back

But it's hard to think of them polite flows
Mr. Fano Poloto suits on your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed

Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit's just been light pole
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back

Black diamond bracelets showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape dis
I make hits and like a bitch just married I ain't miss
Twenty four hours from greatness, I'm that close

Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles, Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' home shows, embarrassed to pull my camera out

And my mother embarrassed to put my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She said I shouldn't have until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around

So she wonder where my mind is and counts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless

And promoters trying to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just see my ex-gurl standing with my next gurl
Standing with the gurl that I'm fuckin' right now

And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing

I've always been something dat these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And still be only tellin' tales, "Damn, drake fly"
And he just be like, "Silly mother fucker, I know"

That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take the records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em

Oh, they did, Pole, at least they try to
And that's what happens when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to, nah

Before they told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause who of known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed in the slightest could of fooled me

Boy, into my city I'm da two to three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and is not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy, understand

I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest versus down at Cabo
So if you find a blackberry with the sides scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know

'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in their verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal

Future said 'cause it's ye shit, you better kill
And I think this got them making of a legend feel
Problem with these other niggas they ain't never real
Yeah, that's all I can say
