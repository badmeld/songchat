I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me man
I hate that shit
It'll be a long time for y'all feel me, if ever
for real
You won't feel me til everybody says they love you but it's not love
And you're suit is ox blood and the girl you fucking hate you and your friends fading all shots of
But you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of

When your famous girlfriend ass keep getting thicker than a plot does And when you forget her that's when she pop up
Then you gotta drop but you ride around with the top up
Forget 3 SUV'S, for, distress like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French laundry and appa valley
Scallops and glasses indojay that shit right up your alley
Yeah, you see a girl and you ask about her, just smiling at ya, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
Its feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through Edward security with your hat down, steady getting a pat down They just keep on saying that they feel you
Yeah, it's been too long
Been way too long
I've been faded too long ooh
I've been faded too long ooh
I've been faded too long ooh
I've been faded too long ooh
I've been faded too long
You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you're in it
And tell the world around you that your paper work is finished
And still your mothers debit card so you maintain a image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted, you need a minute
You got it
You know it's real when you're latest nights is your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home thats just the way in life
Apartment 1503 some couches and paint in's
When you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah, it's starting to feel better than home fields

And so you up there every night you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills

But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs and hopes that you could beat a nigga
And come out every night to let the city see that nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel you
Yeah, it's been too long, man
Faded too long ooh
I haven't been inside terminal 103 in so long
I'm driving right up to it now make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially when summers rolled on
And all you know is alcohol and city lights and slow songs, for 4 months out the years got you asking what's good at home, what's good at home
The same hoes are still at it I should've known
My young niggas popping em's and sipping dirty Jones
Problem children at all be reppin Octobers own
Brand new girl, and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I'm bout to fuck and I'm just praying that it feels good
I really don't know much but shit I know a secret
They say more money more problems my niggas don't believe it
I mean sure there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading
but I blew 6 million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder season switching over I come through them bitches still scorching as if I didn't notice you niggas getting older I see no threat in Yoda
I'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas that couldn't fuck with my freshman floater
Look at that fuckin chip on your nephews shoulder
My sophomore I was all for it, they all saw it
My junior and senior would only get meanor
Take care nigga
