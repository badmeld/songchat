I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man.
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I like to ummm
I like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Yes I call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments.

[Verse 1:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes u aunt Viv
Until u take from me till the point that u can't give.
And when I see u out I pass by it's offensive
But what u expect tho
Kinda direct yo
Cuhz all that dolce and gabana stuff was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy that tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white downed you
Now we sit around the studio and clown you
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick

[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Verse 2:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
My niggas cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that ya'll believe in
Cuhz when I say I'm serious you played u only see them
I plan a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple of years you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin waitin patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cuhz I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losin a feeling
U losin appealing
U need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick

[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Verse 3:]
My first reaction was dead girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But u was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin ya thing to
Sayin to my self u deceiving
You r the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
And fact I know you always be lyin when u be leavin
Goin to visit family promise me u ain't cheatin
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that u a soft nigga
How u think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how u think u last when u really don't
And make u think u get the ass when u really don't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin it
So sign your name on a pre-nub and in initials
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick

[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Drake: talking]
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man (yeah)
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk about
