[feat. Nicki Minaj] 


[Drake:]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A lil attitude problem all good, it'll make shit last
Don't make it too easy girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami tryna study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you'll always be the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wana fight for your right
Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard but girl you got it girl
You got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthaf-ckas wanna waste your time
It's just amazing girl, and all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you

Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you...

[Nicki Minaj:]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm better then
Mansions in Malibu babblin
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta ro-ro-row, gotta row ya boat
It's Pink Friday records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest deal
Best legal team so the deals is I'll
It's Mac, OPI and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, lil gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I'm fli-fli-fly, I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just Hi and bye

Baby you can ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

He asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star, Sheriff badge,
What's the point? If I'm guardin'
Double D up hoes, Dolly Parton

[Chorus: Drake]
