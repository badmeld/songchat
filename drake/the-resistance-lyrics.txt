Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
Uh, uh, nah, I know you all too well

We said that we can kiss the past goodbye
But your weren't excited, there's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty, here I go

Should I spend the weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside the moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget, my memories never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it

I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship

I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a 100 seeds
It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous

It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said
I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead
That's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough

What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit, they say

You promised me you would never change
Oh, huh, huh, oh, huh, huh, oh, huh, huh
You promised me you would never change
Oh, huh, huh, oh, huh, huh

Am I wrong for making light of my situation?
Clap on, when 40 got something for me to snap on
Now that I'm on, I don't wanna worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffett on

I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
That I barely know at all and

Plus this woman that I mess with unprotected
Text us, saying she wish she woulda kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread

It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
'Cause we having the time of our lives right now

What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit, they say

You promised me you would never change
Oh, huh, huh, oh, huh, huh, oh, huh, huh
You promised me you would never change
Oh, huh, huh, oh, huh, huh

I live by some advice this girl, Lisa told me
The other day Lisa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different

Maybe it was the fast pace switch up
Or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe 'cause the girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But a fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked big rich up

I know, the same time, I'm quick to forget
'Bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed

Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money? Baby, hammer time
Yeah, I just need some closure, ain't no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over
