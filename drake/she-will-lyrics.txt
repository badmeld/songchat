Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
(Repeats 3)

And I tell her "go on! Pop that pussy for me"
I'm so outta site, but the blind man looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, get a dollar back

Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about "I" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine...eat her til she cry

Call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'mma have em checkin pulses
Now I like my big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Stevie Wonder to that bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!

You ain't for the realest niggas in the fuckin game right now..
