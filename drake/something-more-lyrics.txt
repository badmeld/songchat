Falling too fast
Clearly rules dont apply
Cant believe that I just met you
You got me here watching minutes pass by

Wondering when to expect you
There you go is this a dream
Looking like every picture that Ive seen of you before

Ive seen it all before now that its over
Should have known better
Then to think this was real
And you could be mine
Should have known better
Slowed it down
Cause I feel you needed time
But I kept thinkin
This could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
Maybe its just nothing at all
But this could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
Maybe its just nothing at all
At all
At all
Maybe its just nothing at all
At all
At all
I guess its what we make it

I guess its what we make it
