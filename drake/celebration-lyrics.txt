How?d I do how?d I do, baby tell me how you feel
They say real girls ain?t never perfect, perfect girls ain?t real
I?d I agree, but I guess we?ll just wait and see
Cause I swear you act like perfect is the only way to be
Nothing matters ?cept for you, don?t let no one out here blind you
Don?t remember why you love me, please allow me to remind you
And I know you left me once, but I came right back to find you
Even though I like being in your past you got a bright future behind you
Oh, damn, oh
Girl I must admit I look amazing next to you
Girl you crazy, sexy, cool and you stayed obsessed to school
But that's good, cause you know that them grades impress me too
And my free days are just for you, but I don?t get many
Its like every time we spend time, it feels like the first time
Cause we never spend enough time, you catch me at the worst time
It ain?t like your not worth time, just I don?t control it
But tonight I made it happen just to celebrate the moment
Give it up one time
