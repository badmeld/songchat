Hey, oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you

Say baby, I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls, they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got

Obvious you're pretty, heard that you're a student
Working weekends in the city, trying to take you out, girl
Hope you're not too busy, and if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to

Put those fucking heels on and work it, girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You be the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they notice, they notice

You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You be the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they notice, they notice, you would shut it

Hey, oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
Killa, killa

Girl, you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl, he's out his mind
You the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind

Hey baby
Every time you come around, shut down like computers
Hey lady
Step into my heart, let me put you into Louboutins

What you want? What you need?
I can be your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it but if they had it
Wouldn't know what to do with it

And together we shut it down, down, down
They know you shut it down, down, down
You be the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they notice, they notice

You would shut it down, down, down
You know you shut it down, down, down
Every time they come around, 'round, 'round
Well, all of them notice, they notice, you shut it down

MC Concrete Loop, you shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations, they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down, down, oh yeah
  (Yes, indeed, you shut it down, down, Drizzy, the American dream)

Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, honest
No you not imagin' it, they lookin' at you, long stares
Even though she standin', now she look like she belongs here

You feel the hours pass until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin
And your cousin fine, but she ain't got my heart beatin' double time

You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?

Damn, I mean, you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around
It's obvious

You shut that thing down, down, down
You shut it down, you shut it down
You shut it down, you shut it down
You shut it, oh, oh

You looking good girl
Go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl
Go, go, go, go, go, go

You looking good girl
Go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl
Go, go, go, go, go, go
You shut it down
