[Trey Songz: {Talking}]
When I first heard this shit (C'mon)*
I told Drake it shoulda been called, over for these other niggas
Yeahhh, (haha)

[Chorus:~Drake~]
I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the f-ck are y'all
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing, what am I doing

[Chorus: ~Trey Songz~]
Oh yeah that's right I'm doin' amazin'
I'm fucking amazin'
I'm gettin' mine right now man
You niggas had a run but it's over, said it's over
I tried to tell ya

[Verse 1: ~Drake~]
Alright, bottles on me
Long as I'm a drink it
Never drop the ball, f-ck y'all thinking
Making sure the young money ship is never sinking
Bout to set it off in this b-tch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Bout to go thriller Mike Jackson on these n-ggas
All I need is a f-cking red jackets with some zippers
Super good smito a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them, well f-ck it me either
But point the biggest skeptic out I'll make them a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I've done it throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones b-tch I run it ahh,

[Verse 1: ~Trey Songz~]
Ay, father I'm at awe, of everything you give to me
Praying negativity will never ever live in me
Ain't nobody wrote mine, ain't nobody co-signed
'member hanging clothes on my Aunt Felicia clothes line
'member telling hoes I'm a blow cause of my dope rhyme
Coulda never told I'd be singing when it's showtime
Solar eclipse back when son got no shine
5 years later I arrive, no time
I been nuts, it's just nobody rode mine
Got my own lane now, shit the whole road's mine
I feel HOV at his best, blueprint
I'm heel-toes at they neck, shoe print
Peep the way I kick it, like a sneaker to the beat
R.I.P. like the Reaper took the beat
Instrumental killer, desert eagle to the beat
See, I'm stronger than the strongest so the weak will never eat (ay)

[Chorus: ~Trey Songz~]
I know way too many people mad right now
'Cause I made a lot of cash here
Get up off my balls
I swear feels like the past few years
I done pass my peers but I just can't remember 'em all
What am I doin', what I am doin'

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2: ~Drake~]
Uhhh,
One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got this sh-t that makes these b-tches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that it's just game
It's just what comes from fame
And I'm ready for that I'm just saying but
I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, even Anne Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me can you see me get your visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture
Turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'm a quit before I die dream on
Man they treat me like a legend
Am I really this cold
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it who you kidding man
Nobody's ever done it like I did it
Ahh

[Verse 2: ~Trey Songz~]
Aye
Mother fuck the world, my mother fucked my daddy
Then my mother fuckin had me, now I'm popping like some acne
Mother fuck my daddy, guess I'm still mad we
Never had a real talk about it, it's my life so who the fuck were you to walk up out it
And I be trying hard to forget about it, still I 'member everything about it
Excuse my emotional discharge, I'm blossoming often
I wanna call but get pissed off
As I oppose the top, I'm only getting lonelier
Everything that was real is only seeming phonier
Tryna see how many mill I can pony up
Find somebody grown to fuck, lemme call Toni up (Nigga What? !)
They used to go, whose he? that's word to moo me
Paper on these books, no looseleaf, truly
If the throne's behind the door, u see I'm at it like a new reef
Watch back, pardon 'scuse me

[Chorus: ~Drake~]
I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the f-ck are y'all
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing, what am I doing
Oh yeah that's right, I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now man
And this what I'm do til it's over
Til it's over, but it's far from over
