How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I've been through
It's been one of those days, you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right, now that I'm here, baby

Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah
Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah
Show me a good, show me a good
Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spendin' all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret

I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Tellin' everybody that I know
We about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't tryna look like I lied to these niggas that I came up with

That's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doin' right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream

I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go to God for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink, girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I've been through
It's been one of those days, you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right, now that I'm here, baby

Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah
Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah
Show me a good, show me a good
Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

How 'bout you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed
Make the most out of tonight
And worry 'bout it all tomorrow

Understand girl, we fam, girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl, Barack Hussein

Tell me can we kick it
Like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate it when a backpack
Rapper get rich and start livin' that life, dawg

Feels like when you get into that paper
Hip-hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our nature

Young and rich and out of control
Out in LA throwin' clouds at the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'ma spend another 10,000 for Dilla

Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch I made it
Yup

How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I've been through
It's been one of those days, you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right, now that I'm here, baby

Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah
Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah
Show me a good, show me a good
Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah
Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah
Show me a good, show me a good
Show me a good time, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
