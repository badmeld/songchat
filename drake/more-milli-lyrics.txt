Make it so fresh, YM,
So fly so priceless, CMB B-tch,
Just another day on the
Top floor of the balcony b-tch,
Live it how we live it,
Mula, Drizzy,
You what it is, young appreciate that,
It's big money poppin baby boy,
Ain't none of that lil biddy,
More, mo more milli,
More, mo more milli,

Yeah,.. pearl white candy paint job fly,
Big timer on the loose,
Got a b-tch riding five,
And everytime I pull up you know I'm iced up,
When I step up in the club I light the b-tch up,
Back on my saddle throwing purple out the truck,
Candy paint rally stripe shining like us,
Pearly white maybach, hatchback automatic straps stash spots under the rack,
B-tch, ready to spray that,
Foreign grinds hard times,
Getting mines, you know up town,
Big time doing time,
You know, Harley Davis baby,
Cash money is pay me so you pay me how it weigh,
Baby, black, gold,
100 mill off the floor,
Never told now you know how it go b-tch,
One hundred, one hundred,

[Drake:]
Yeah
Your now f-cking with the most requested,
The young n-gga that everybody is so obsessed with,
And balck on black 62 float majestic,
Me and stunna in it, boy I'm just so connected,
Caught up in a popularity contest,
It's about to reach my dreams and I ain't even got my arms stretched,
Thank me later first week I'm taking all bets,
Because a million copies isn't really far fetched,
I keep credit cards in cash knots,
I keep my darkest shades on til the flash stops,
It's for my LA girls getting them implants,
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots,
Got em for a reason shortie, go ahead buss it open,
I keep a secret baby, nothings heard when nothings spoken,
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion,
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the f-cking ocean,
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star,
Are confused all the conversations between y'all,
And dog that's funny, pay me what you know n-gga,
All cash money.
