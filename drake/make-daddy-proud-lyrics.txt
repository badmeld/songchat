Hoes... hoes...
Hoes, hoes, ho

I'm stuntin' on my old bitch, shittin' on her new nigga
Question why we so rich, don't worry how shit goes down
She lovin' my piano keys, well how you think I feel baby
I'm numb I'm numb, so I'mma throw this money till it's done
Oh I yeah, love it when you take it low
You love it when my money falls
I love it when you make it go, give it to me ah yeah ah uh, ah yeah, ahh

Alright
She always tryin' call my phone
Say she think about me when she all alone
Darkness upon us, the eyes of this monster glowin' gold
Tryna reach your thoughts, but you say your conscious is growin' old
And I know you got some feelings that you can't control
But all them fucking feelings hit the ceiling when you on that pole
These women looking appealing, at all my shows
But I ain't got no time for these bitches, trying to get some dough
Heard that you got work tonight, all my niggas down to go
Heard that I'm been working right that's how you know I'm down to blow
Making money doin' me, and spending doe that's all I know
Throw a stack its coming back, I boomerang my money flow
Killing every track I'm on, but I bet younever notice
Now I go out to do whatever people takin' photos
Smoking on that loud like a megaphone
And baby bring it up and drop it down
And then she let it go, yeah

Love the way you take it low
You love the way my money falls
Throw it when you make it go
Tell me that you love me
You keep saying every time is the last time
You never listen to us
Every thing is slow when you're fast down
I'm a victim of lust
So baby

Make daddy proud
Baby get ya mind right
Put in overtime like
Like we gonna put it down like
Make daddy proud
You already know I'm one
You gonna have to show me something
Do it like you owe me one
Make daddy proud
Do it till its over done
And tell me I'm the only one
Make daddy proud

Ok you do it, yeah you do it girl they ain't be nothin' to it
Just put motion in emotion, and I be throwin' potion in
I talkin' bout that drank
You know what the fuck I think
I throw this pink up in my sprite
