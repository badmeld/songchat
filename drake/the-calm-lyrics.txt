I'm just so far gone, October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne, screaming in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is going on

Where did we go wrong? Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
With my diamond chain's on still nothing setting stone

Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget them and I promise that I won't
Feeling so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone

Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years, look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm

Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face even read it on my palm

Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'd be better if you don't
'Cause

You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you now, put y'all in this position [Incomprehensible]
40 Mama always say don't ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah

And life is so insane
Look what I became, tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a vantage you can gain

They love it when you smile
Unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with
When you're born to entertain

Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say you're the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Terrence in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne

It's a weight that's on my chest who ever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone, trynin' not to get a sprain
Hopin' Western Junior doin' currency exchange
'Cause my dad called, it got me feeling guilty and ashamed

Like I had a Rolls and I went and got a range
And he payin' for his cigarettes
With some dollars and some change, damn

And I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there is only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain

I'm why your girls heart is in a slain call me Heartbreak Drake
I'm the hardest one to tame, as a man
I'm just honest as an artist, I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain

Yeah, and see this is the thang
What they viewin' as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while starin' out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain me, yeah

I said I call this shit the calm
But I'm the furthest thing from calm
That's why I'm putting on but they always wanna ask
What type of act you putting on, like damn
