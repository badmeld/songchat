[Intro]
Toronto
Toronto!

[Drake]
I guess this is goodbye, goodnight and good luck
I'm sittin outside man I'm ridin' the truck
Bags packed packin' black and milds lightin' them up
I'm lookin down on these niggas while invitin' them up
I like to know the reasonin behind sub-liminals
Like who told them to mention me
I am elevated homie you are elementary
Tellin em you sellin dope and never sold a century sayin'
You get denied off your entry exam
You get one flow and your done for
Converse on one verse about you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I stay fly
On the cell phone and got a tint on the other end like an Eight-By
Six-two and they tell me you yay high
They can't but they try
Still get offended if I don't say "hi"
To me it's kind of gay if I'm saying "hi" to like eight guys
So I just walk past them and keep it cool until the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot I could send these cats
Like, "Here, sit on this island man and pin these raps"
Bust these shots pretend you're trapped
Do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun I miss the CTV
Atleast I'm not mister dick-riding CTE
Rappers believe me
I'm cutting records with Jody Breeze
And that nigga would even admit that you're flowin cheesy
But slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song
Will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow the over-easy I'm a swisson
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn a charm they they cannot resist on
If they want to smoke then get their purple smoke and twist on
But I can't call it
Maybe you mad because you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant
And I'm official was officially true
Is calling names would only be beneficial to you
I just tire of you niggas y'all the Michellin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And you
You're smaller to me than a thumbtack
Musics enjoyable I'm just trying to bring the fun back
But you making it hard with these dumb tracks
Your LL16s
Because I listen to them and I don't call it a comeback
It's more like a shame and digrace
Considering I'm the one you aim at this place
But you are the one I blame in this case
I doubt you'll experience much of that
Desire fame at this rate
Awkward ass singles
The lamest mixtapes
And this ones making you say you came to get Drake
Well I'm thinkin the hoods right for you
The sunshines on my career is goodnight for you
I'm thinkin the hoods right for you
The sunshines on my career is goodnight for you
