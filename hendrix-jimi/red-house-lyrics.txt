RED HOUSE
AH YEAH
THERE'S A RED HOUSE OVER YONDER
THAT'S WHERE MY BABY STAYS
LORD THERE'S A RED HOUSE OVER YONDER
LORD THAT'S WHERE MY BABY STAYS

I AIN'T BEEN HOME TO SEE MY BABY
IN NINETY-NINE AND ONE HALF DAYS
WAIT MINUTE SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE
THE KEY WON'T UNLOCK THIS DOOR

WAIT A MINUTE SOMETHING'S WRONG 
LORD HAVE MERSY THOS KEY WON'T UNLOCK THE DOOR
WAIT A MINUTE SOMTHING'S WRONG HERE
I HAVE A BAD BAD FEELING
THAT MY BABY DON'T LIVE HERE NO MORE
THAT'S ALRIGHT I STILL GOT MY GUITAR, LOOK OUT NOW
YEAH

WELL I MIGHT AS WELL A GO ON BACK DOWN 
WAY BACK UP ON THE HILL 
LORD I MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK OVER YONDER 
WAY BACK YONDER ACROSS THE HILL

CAUSE IF MY BABY DON'T LOVE ME NO MORE 
I KNOW HERE SISTER! BABY!
