MESSAGE TO THE UNIVERSE (MESSAGE TO LOVE)
ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO, THREE

WELL I TRAVEL AT THE SPEED UNKNOWN TO MAN
SO I BRANG YOU A MESSAGE FROM THE MIRRORS OF MY HAND
I SAID A MESSAGE OF LOVE DON'T YOU HID AWAY
FACE THE MIRRORS OF YOUR MIND
FACE THE TRUTH TODAY

WELL I AM WHAT I AM THANK GOD
LORD SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HELP THEM GOD
I SAID FIND YOURSELF FIRST
AND THEN YOUR TOOL 
FIND YOURSELF FIRST 
JUST DON'T BE NO FOOL

I SEE A WOMAN COMIN' 
I SEE YA LAYIN' ON YOUR BACK
FOR THE BIRTH OF PLEASURE
I SEE YOU ON THE RIGHT TRACK
FREE IS FREE
YOU AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE
NOW DON'T RELY ON NO MAN
TRY TO ARGUE INSTEAD
I SAID FIND YOURSELF FIRST 
AND THEN YOUR TALENT
WORK HARD IN YOUR MIND

AND PROOVE TO THE MAN
YOUR AS STRONG AS HIM
IN THE EYES OF GOD
