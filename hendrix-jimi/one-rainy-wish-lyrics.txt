ONE RAINY WISH
GOLD AND ROSE, THE COLOR OF THE DREAM I HAD
NOT TOO LONG AGO
A MISTY BLUE AND THE LILAC TOO
A NEVER TO GROW OLD

THERE YOU WERE UNDER THE TREE OF SONG
SLEEPING SO PEACEFULLY
IN YOUR HAND A FLOWER PLAYED 
A WAITING THERE FOR ME

I HAVE NEVER
LAID EYES ON YOU
NOT LIKE THIS BEFORE
THIS TIMELESS DAY
A BUT YOU WALKED AND YA HA
ONCE SMILED MY NAME
AND YOU STOLE
MY HEART AWAY
A STOLE MY HEART AWAY LITTLE GIRL, YEAH
ALL RIGHT

GOLD AND ROSE THE COLOR OF THE DREAM I HAD
NOT TOO LONG AGO
MISTY BLUE AND LILAC TOO
A NEVER TO GROW OLD

GOLD AND ROSE THE COLOR OF THE DREAM I HAD
MISTY BLUE AND LILAC TOO
GOLD AND ROSE THE COLOR OF THE DREAM I HAD
MISTY BLUE AND LILAC TOO
GOLD AND ROSE, GOLD AND ROSE, GOLD AND ROSE

IT'S ONLY A DREAM
I'D LOVE TO TELL SOMEBODY ABOUT THIS DREAM
THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH A THOUSAND STARS
WHILE THE SUN KISSED THE MOUNTAINS BLUE
AND ELEVEN MOONS PLAYED ACROSS THE RAINBOWS
ABOVE ME AND YOU 
GOLD AND ROSE THE COLOR OF THE VELVET WALLS SURROUND US
