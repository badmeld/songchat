LONG HOT SUMMER NIGHT
SHOW US A LONG
LONG, LONG HOT SUMMER NIGHT 
AS FAR AS MY EYES COULD SEE
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH
WELL MY HEART WAS WAY DOWN
COLD COLD WINTER STONE
WELL MY DARLIN' WHERE CAN YOU BE
WHERE CAN YOU BE BABY
WHERE CAN YOU BE

THERE WERE THREE SUGAR CANE WALLS
AND TWO CANDY CANE WINDOWS
BUT THE SILLYEST MOVE WELTED ALL THOSE INSIDE
WELL EVERYBODY'S ON FIRE, BUT ITS 
A SNOWIN' IN A COLD BLIZZARD

WHERE ARE YOU IN THIS A HOT COLD SUMMER?
WHERE ARE YOU IN THIS A HOT COLD SUMMER?
WHERE ARE YOU IN THIS A HOT COLD SUMMER?
GOD, GOD, GOD

AROUND ABOUT THIS TIME THE TELEPHONE 
BLEW ITS HORN ACROSS THE ROOM
SCARED LITTLE ANNIE 
CLEAN OUT OF HER MIND
OUT OF HER MIND

AND GRABBED LITTLE ANNIE FROM THE SINK JUST IN TIME
AND THE TELEPHONE JUST KEEPS ON SCREAMIN'
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH

"HELLO," SAID MY SHAKY VOICE 
"WELL, HOW YOU DOING"
I STARTED TO STUTER
AH, AH, CAN'T YOU TELL THAT I'M DOIN' FINE
CAN'T YOU TELL I'M DONIN' FINE
IT WAS MY BABY TALKIN' 
WAY DOWN ACROSS THE BORDER
SHE SAYS "I'M GOIN' TO HURRY TO YA, I'VE BEEN A FOOL,
AND I'M TIRED OF CRYIN'"
AH, AH,
YEAH

I SAID A LONG 
LONG, HOT SUMMER NIGHT 
AS FAR AS MY EYES COULD SEE
AS FAR AS MY EYES
I COULD FEEL THE HEAT COMIN' ON
AS MY BABY'S GETTEN CLOSER
I'M SO GLAD MY BABY'S COMIN' TO RESCUE ME
SO GLAD MY BABY'S COMIN' TO RESCUE ME
MY BABY'S COMIN' TO RESCUE ME
RESCUE 
RESCUE 

ETC.
