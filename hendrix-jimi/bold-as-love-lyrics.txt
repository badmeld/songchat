Axis: Bold As Love
BOLD AS LOVE
ANGER! HE SMILES
TOWERINING SHINY METALLIC PURPLE ARMOUR
QUEEN JEALOUSY ENVY WAITS BEHIND HIM
HER FIREY GREEN GOWN SNEERS AT THE GRASSY GOUND

BLUE ARE THE LIFE-GIVING WATERS TAKEN FOR GRANTED
THEY QUIETLY UNDERSTAND
ONCE HAPPY TURQUOISE ARMIES LAY OPPOSITE READY
BUT WONDER WHY THE FIGHT IS ON

BUT THEY ALL BOLD AS LOVE
YEAH
THEY ALL BOLD AS LOVE 
YEAH
THEY ALL BOLD AS LOVE 
JUST ASK THE AXIS

MY RED IS SO CONFIDENT HE FLASHES TROPHIES OF WAR 
AND RIBBONS OF EUPHORIA
ORANGE IS YOUNG FULL OF DARING
BUT VERY UNSTEADY FOR THE FIRST GO 'ROUND

MY YELLOW IN THIS CASE IS NOT SO MELLOW
IN FACT I'M TRYING TO SAY IT'S FRIGHTENED LIKE ME
AND ALL THESE EMOTIONS OF MINE KEEP HOLDING ME FROM UH
GIVING MY LIFE TO A RAINBOW LIKE YOU

BUT I'M UH YEAH I'M BOLD AS LOVE
YEAH YEA-AH
WELL I'M BOLD, BOLD AS LOVE 
HEAR ME TALKING GIRL
I'M BOLD AS LOVE
JUST ASK THE AXIS
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH
