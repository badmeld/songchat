BURNING OF THE MIDNIGHT LAMP
THE MORNING IS DEAD
AND THE DAY IS TOO
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT HERE TO GREET ME
BUT THE VELEVET MOON
ALL MY LONELINESS
I HAVE FELT TODAY
IT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO MAKE A MAN THROW HIMSELF AWAY
I CONTINUE
TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT LAMP 
ALONE

NOW THE SMILING PORTRAIT OF YOU
IS STLL HANGIN' ON MY FROWNING WALL
BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T REALLY DOESN'T BOTHER ME TOO MUCH AT ALL
IT'S JUST THE, UH, EVER FALLING DUST 
THAT MAKES IT SO HARD FOR ME TO SEE
THAT FORGOTTEN EAR-RING LAYING ON THE FLOOR
FACING COLDLY TOWARD THE DOOR
AND I CONTINUE
TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT LAMP
WHOA, ALONE

BURN
YEAH YEAH
LONELY LONELY LONELY
LONELINESS IS SUCH A, DRAG

SO HERE I SIT TO FACE 
THAT SAME OLD FIRE PLACE 
GETTIN' READY FOR THE SAM OLD EXPLOSION
GOIN' THROUGH MY MIND 
AND SOON ENOUGH TIME WILL TELL
ABOUT THE CIRCUS AND THE WISHINGWELL
AND SOMEONE WHO WILL BY AND SELL FOR ME
SOMEONE WHO WILL TOLL MY BELL 
AND I CONTINUE TO BURN THE SAME OLD LAMP 
ALONE

YEAH, RIGHT NOW 
CAN YOU HEAR ME CALLIN' YOU SO LONELY 
GOTTA BLOW MY MIND 
YEAH YEAH
LONELY LONELY LONELY
BLOW MY MIND
YEAH
