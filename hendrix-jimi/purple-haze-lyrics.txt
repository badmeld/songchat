Are You Experienced?
PURPLE HAZE
PURPLE HAZE ALL IN MY BRAIN 
LATELY THINGS DON'T SEEM THE SAME
ACTIN' FUNNY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY
'SCUSE ME WHILE I KISS THE SKY

PURPLE HAZE ALL AROUND
DON'T KNOW IF I'M COMIN' UP OR DOWN
AM I HAPPY OR IN MISERY?
WHATEREVER IT IS, THAT GIRL PUT A SPELL ON ME

HELP ME
HELP ME
OH I DON'T KNOW

YEAH!
PURPLE HAZE WAS ALL IN MY EYES
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S DAY OR NIGHT
YOU'VE GOT ME BLOWIN', BLOWIN' MY MIND
IS IT TOMORROW OR JUST THE END OF TIME?

WHO KNOWS?
HELP ME 
YEAH
COME ON NOW 
TELL ME 
TELL ME 

ETC.
