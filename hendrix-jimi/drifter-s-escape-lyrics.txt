DRIFTER'S ESCAPE
OH, HELP ME IN MY WEAKNESS
I HEARD THE DRIFTER SAY
AS THEY CARRIED HIM FROM THE COURT ROOM 
AND WERE TAKING HIM AWAY
WELL, MY TRIP HASN'T BEEN A PLEASANT ONE
AND MY TIME IT ISN'T LONG
AND I STILL DO NOT KNOW 
WHAT IS WAS THAT I'VE DONE WRONG

WELL THE JUDGE HE CAST HIS ROBE ASIDE
A TEAR CAME TO HIS EYE
WELL YOU FAIL TO UNDERSTAND, HE SAID
WHY MUST YOU EVEN TRY
OUTSIDE THE CROWD WAS STIRRING
YOU COULD HEAR IT FROM THE DOOR
INSIDE THE JUDGE WAS STEPPING DOWN
WHILE THE JURY CRIED FOR MORE, MORE, MORE
CRIED FOR MORE, CRIED FOR MORE

HEY YOU BETTER LEAVE THAT BOY'S SOUL ALONE

OH STOP THAT PASSING THE JURY
GRAB ME A TENDON AND ME A NURSE
OH, THE TRIAL WAS BAD ENOUGH
YES, BUT THIS IS TEN TIMES WORSE
JUST THEN BOLT OF LIGHTNING
SHOWED THE COURT HOUSE OUT OF SHAPE
AND WHILE EVERYBODY KNELT TO PRAY
THE DRIFTER MADE HIS ESCAPE
THE DRIFTER DID HIS ESCAPE
YEAH
SO LONG
