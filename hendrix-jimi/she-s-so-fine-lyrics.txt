Axis: Bold As Love
SHE'S SO FINE
SHE WALKS WITH A BELL-CLOCK ROUND HER NECK
SO THE HIPPIES THINK SHE'S IN WITH TIME
TIME...
HER HAIR GLISTENS LIKE ROBINS ON A DECK
BRANCHES ATACK ME FROM HER NECK

SHE'S SO FINE
SHE'S SO VERY VERY FINE

THE SUN FROM A CLOUD SINKS INTO HER EYES
THE RAIN FROM A TREE SOKES INTO HER MIND
MIND...
MORNING SIGN SOUNDS JUST LIKE A LOCK
ALL THESE SIGNS ARE ALWAYS A STOCK

SHE'S SO FINE
SHE'S SO VERY VERY FINE

WHEN I VEER I GET SO NEAR
BUT SO FAR FAR FAR AWAY
LISTEN TO ME TODAY

WE UNITED JUST BESIDE A LEAF
THE GROUND WAS HARD UNDERNEATH HER HER

AHHHAHHH
SHE'S SO FINE
AHHHAHHH
