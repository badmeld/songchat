LOOK OVER YONDER
LOOK OVER YONDER HERE COME THE BLUES
THE THIRTEENTH OF ANY TIME, POWERED BY FOOLS
I CAN SEE 'EM COMIN'
WEARING A BLUE ARMOURED COAT
YOU'RE SITTIN' HERE WITH YOUR VIOLINS
HITTIN' WRONG NOTES
LOOK OVER YONDER, HE'S COMIN' MY WAY
WHEN HE'S AROUND, I NEVER HAVE A HAPPY DAY
(YOU EVEN BUST MY GUITAR STRINGS)

LOOK OVER YONDER, LOOK OVER YONDER, LOOK OVER YONDER ETC.

LOOK OVER YONDER
WELL, HE'S TALKIN' TO MY BABY
THEY FOUND MY PEACE PIPE ON HER
NOW THEY'RE DRAGGIN' HER AWAY
LORD KNOWS WE DON'T NEED A DEVIL LIKE HIM BEATIN' US AROUND
WELL, HE'S KNOCKIN' ON MY DOOR
HOW MY HOUSE IS TUMBLIN' DOWN

NOW DON'T YOU COME NO CLOSER
THE PATH IS KEEPIN' ME BOLDER
WAIT BY MY DOOR BABY
UNLESS YOU WANT TO START ANOTHER WAR
LOOK OVER YONDER, HEY
LOOK OVER YONDER 
LOOK OVER YONDER
LOOK OVER YONDER
