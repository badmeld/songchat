Are You Experienced?
ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?
IF YOU CAN JUST GET YOUR MIND TOGETHER
THEN COME ON ACROSS TO ME
WE'LL HOLD HANDS AND THEN WE'LL WATCH 
THE SUN RISE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
BUT FIRST

ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?
AH HAVE YOU EVER BEEN EXPERIENCED?
WELL I HAVE

I KNOW I KNOW
YOU'LL PROBABLY SCREAM AND CRY
THAT YOUR LITTLE WORLD WON'T LET YOU GO
BUT WHO IN YOUR MEASLY LITTLE WORLD ARE TRYING TO PROVE THAT
YOUR'RE MADE OUT OF GOLD AND CAN'T BE SOLD

SO A ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN EXPERIENCED?
WELL, I HAVE

AH LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU

TRUMPETS AND VIOINS I CAN A HEAR IN THE DISTANCE
I THINK THEY'RE CALLING OUR NAMES
MAYBE NOW YOU CAN'T HEAR THEM BUT YOU WILL HAHA
IF YOU JUST TAKE HOLD OF MY HAND

OH BUT ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN EXPERIENCED?

NOT NECESSARILY STONED BUT BEAUTIFUL
