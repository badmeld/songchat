RAINY DAY DREAM AWAY
COUGH, COUGH, SNIFF, SNIFF
HEY MAN, TAKE A LOOK OUT THE WINDOW 
AND SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING
HEY MAN, ITS RAININ' ITS RAININ' OUTSIDE MAN
OH DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT, BROTHER
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE EVERYTHING
WE'LL GET INTO SOMETHING REAL NICE, YOU KNOW
WHY DON'T YA SIT BACK AND GROOVE ON A RAINY DAY

SNIF, YEAH
SNIFF
YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN BROTHER
MAYBE I CAN GROOVE

RAINY DAY DREAM AWAY
LET THE SUN TAKE A HOLIDAY
FLOWERS BATHE AND UH
SEE THE CHILDREN PLAY 
LAY BACK AND GROOVE ON A RAINY DAY
WELL I CAN SEE A BUNCH OF WET PREACHERS, LOOK AT 'EM ON THE RUN
THE CARNIVAL TRAFIC NOISE, IT SINKS
INTO THE SPLASHY HUM
EVEN THE DUCKS CAN GROOVE 
RAIN BURDEND IN A PARK-SIDE POOL
AND I'M LEANIN OUT MY WINDOW SILL
DIGGIN' EVERYTHING
AND UH YOU TOO

RAINY DAY RAIN ALL DAY
AIN'T NO USE IN GETTIN' UP TONIGHT
JUST LET IT GROOVE ITS OWN WAY 
LET IT DRAIN
YOUR WORIES AWAY
LAY BACK AND GROOVE ON A RAINY DAY
LAY BACK AND DREAM ON A RAINY DAY
