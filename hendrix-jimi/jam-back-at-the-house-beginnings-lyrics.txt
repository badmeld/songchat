JAM BACK AT THE HOUSE (BEGINNINGS)
JIMI:
"YEAH WELL A LIKE I SAID BEFORE WE ONLY RAN UP A FEW NUMBERS SO LET
ME TRY AND DO THIS ONE LIKE WE WERE JUST JAMMIN' AT THE HOUSE WE DON'T HAVE
A NAME FOR YET IT'S JUST LIKE AN INSTRUMENTAL SO WE'LL JUST GO ALONG WITH IT. 
IT GOES SOMTHIN' LIKE THIS." 


NO LYRICS. IT'S AN INSTURMENTAL LIKE JIMI SAID, BUT A GREAT INSTRUMENTAL.


JIMI:
"BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER WE'D LIKE TO SAY THAT YOU ALL REALLY HAD A LOT OF PASHENTS
THREE DAYS WORTH. YOU'VE PROOVED TO THE WORLD WHAT CAN HAPPEN WITH A LITTLE BIT OF 
LOVE AND SOUNDS. OH, I LEFT MY GIRLFRIEND AT HOME I'M SORRY. I'D LIKE TO DO A THING
THAT A NEW AMERICAN ANTHEM UNTIL WE GET ANOTHER ON TOGETHER. THIS IS CALLED 'VOODOO
CHILD (SLIGHT RETURN)'."
