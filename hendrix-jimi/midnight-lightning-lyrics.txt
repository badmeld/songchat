MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING
MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING
FLASHING ALL AROUND ME
LORD, SEE IT FLASHIN' ALL AROUND THE TREES
SEE IT FLASHIN' ON MY LOVE AND ME
WAKE UP MY SWEET DARLIN'
AND SEE THE LIGHT UPON YOUR EYES
BLUE LIGHT FLASHIN'
SHADOW'S LEAPIN' CHURCH BELLS RING MADE AGAINST THE NIGHT
HEY MY LOVE PLEASE STAND UP AND WATCH ME 
MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING FLASHIN'
FLASHIN' ALL AROUND MY COUNTRY HOUSE
THUNDER FLASHIN'
SEE WHERE THE FIELDS LIE ON OUR TREE IN OUR LITTLE DREAM
