ONCE I HAD A WOMAN
LORD, I HAD A WOMAN
LORD KNOWS SHE WAS GOOD TO ME IN EVERY WAY
YES, I HAD A WOMAN
A REAL WOMAN
LORD, SHE GAVE ME LOVEN BOTH NIGHT AND DAY
MY SUN SHINE
WHOO HOO
FOR MY WOMAN
OR ELSE OR ELSE
ITS GOING TO TAKE ME ONE MORE DAY
IF IT TAKES ME
SHE WENT WAY DOWN IN DALLAS
WAY DOWN IN TEXAS LAND
LORD SHE HAD ME WRAPPED AROUND HER WRIST AND AROUND HER FINGER BABY
LIKE A RING WRAPPED AROUND A FINGER OF A SEVERED HAND
I'M LOOKIN' FOR MY DALLAS HONEY BEE
WHO CAN YOU BE
WHO CAN YOU BE
OOOH HOO HOO HELP ME
HELP ME LOOK FOR HER
OH YEAH
