NIGHT BIRD FLYING
SHE'S JUST A NIGHT BIRD FLYIN' THROUGH THE NIGHT
FLY ON
SHE'S JUST A NIGHT BIRD MAKIN' A MIDNIGHT, MIDNIGHT FLY
SAIL ON 
SAIL ON
WELL SHE'S FLYIN' DOWN TO ME
UNTIL TOMORROW I CAN SET HER FREE
SET HER FREE
SO ALL WE GOT BABY IS ONE PRECIOUS NIGHT
ALL WE GOT IS ONE PRECIOUS NIGHT
PUT ON YOUR BLUES AND SHOES AND THINGS AND RAGS
DOWN UNDER THE BED
JUST WRAP ME UP IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL WINGS 
YOU BETTER HEAR WHAT I SAY YEAH
OH, CARRY ME BABY

PLEASE TAKE ME THROUGH YOUR DREAMS
INSIDE YOUR WORLD I WANT TO BE
UNTIL TOMORROW, NO TEARS WILL BE SHED
HOLD ON UNTIL THE SUN GETS OUT OF BED
HOLD ON WELL HOLD ON BABY

SAIL ON SAIL ON SAIL ON
SAIL ON
RIGHT IN MY ARMS BABY
