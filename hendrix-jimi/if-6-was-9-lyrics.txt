Hendrix Jimi
Axis: Bold As Love
IF 6 WAS 9
YEAH SING THE SONG BRO'

IF THE SUN REFUSE TO SHINE
I DON'T MIND, I DON'T MIND
IF THE MOUNTAINS FELL IN THE SEA
LET IT BE, IT AIN'T ME
ALRIGHT 
'CAUSE I GOT MY OWN WORLD TO LOOK THROUGH
AND I, AND I AIN'T GONNA COPY YOU

NOW IF A 6 TURNED OUT TO BE 9
I DON'T MIND, I DON'T MIND
ALRIGHT, IF ALL THE HIPPIES CUT OFF ALL THEIR HAIR
I DON'T CARE, I DON'T CARE
DIG 'CAUSE I GOT MY OWN WORLD TO LIVE THROUGH
AND I AIN'T GONNA COPY YOU

WHITE COLLARED CONSERVATIVE FLASHING DOWN THE STREET
POINTING THEIR PLASTIC FINGER AT ME
THEY'RE HOPING SOON MY KIND WILL DROP AND DIE
BUT I'M GONNA WAVE MY FREAK FLAG HIGH, HIGH!

WAVE ON, WAVE ON

HA HA
FALL MOUNTAINS JUST DON'T FALL ON ME
GO AHEAD ON MR. BUSINESS MAN YOU CAN'T DRESS LIKE ME
SING ON BROTHER PLAY ON DRUMMER

SO LET ME LIVE MY LIFE THE WAY I WANT TO
YEAH
SING ON BROTHER PLAY ON
