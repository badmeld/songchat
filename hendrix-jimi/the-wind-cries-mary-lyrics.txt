Are you experienced?
THE WIND CRIES MARY
AFTER ALL JACKS ARE IN THEIR BOXES
AND THE CLOWNS HAVE ALL GONE TO BED
YOU CAN HEAR HAPPINESS STAGGERING ON DOWN THE STREET
FOOTPRINTS DRESSED IN RED

AND THE WIND WHISPERS MARY

A BROOM IS DREARILY SWEEPING
UP THE BROKEN PIECES OF YESTERDAY'S LIFE
SOMEWHERE A QUEEN IS WEEPING
SOMEWHERE A KING HAS NO WIFE

AND THE WIND CRIES MARY

THE TRAFIC LIGHTS THEY TURN A BLUE TOMORROW
AND SHINE THER EMPTINESS DOWN ON MY BED
THE TINY ISLAND SAGS DOWNSTREAM
CAUSE THE LIFE THAT THEY LIVED IS DEAD

AND THE WIND SCREAMS MARY

WILL THE WIND EVER REMEMBER
THE NAMES IT HAS BLOWN IN THE PAST
AND WITH ITS CRUTCH ITS OLD AGE AND ITS WISDOM
IT WHISPERS "NO, THIS WILL BE THE LAST"

AND THE WIND CRIES MARY
