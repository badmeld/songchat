I DON'T KNOW

Y'ALL PALL ME THAT BOTTLE
AND I'LL SING YOU ALL A REAL SONG
YEAH!
LET ME GET MY KEY AHUM

WELL I'M LOOKING THROUGH HARLEM
MY STOMACH SQUEAL JUST A LITTLE MORE
A STAGECOACH FULL OF FEATHERS AND FOOTPRINTS
PULLS UP TO MY SOAP-BOX DOOR
NOW A LADY WITH A PEARL-HANDLED NECKTIE
TIED TO THE DRIVER'S FENCE
BREATHES IN MY FACE
BOURBON AND COKE POSSESED WORDS
HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE IN HELL
OR WAS IT JUST AN ACCIDENT?
YOU KNOW HOW I FELT THEN 
AND SO A

BEFORE I COULD ASK WAS IT THE EAST OR WEST SIDE?
MY FEET THEY HOWLED IN PAIN
THE WHEELS OF A BANDWAGON CUT VERY DEEP
BUT NOT AS DEEP IN MY MIND AS THE RAIN
AND AS THEY PULLED AWAY I COULD SEE HER WORDS
STAGGER AND FALLIN' ON MY MUDDY TENT
WELL I PICKED THEM UP BRUSHED THEM OFF
TO SEE WHAT THEY SAY
AND YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
'COME AROUND TO MY ROOM WITH THE TOOTH IN THE MIDDLE 
AND BRING ALONG THE BOTTLE AND A PRESIDENT'

AND-EH SOMETIMES IT'S NOT SO EASY, BABY
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR ONLY FRIEND 
TALKS SEES LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE YOU
AND YOU DO JUST THE SAME AS HIM
GETS VERY LONELY UP THIS ROAD BABY
YEAH HMM YEAH

GOT MORE TO SAY

WELL I'M RIDING THROUGH LA HA
ON A BICYCLE BUILT FOR FOOLS 
AND I SEEN ONE OF MY OLD BUDDIES
AND HE SAY 'YOU DON'T LOOK THE WAY YOU USUALLY DO'
I SAY ' WELL SOME PEOPLE LOOK LIKE A COIN-BOX'
HE SAY 'LOOK LIKE YOU AIN'T GOT NO COINS TO SPARE'
AND I LAID BACK AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, AND I SAID THIS
I JUST PICKED UP MY PRIDE FORM UNDERNEATH THE PAY PHONE
AND COMBED THIS BREATH RIGHT OU OF MY HAIR
AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT SO EASY
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR ONLY FRIEND
TALKS SEES LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE YOU
AND YOU DO JUST THE SAME AS HIM

I JUST GOT OUT OF A SCANDINAVIAN JAIL
AND I'M ON MY WAY STRAIGHT HOME TO YOU
BUT I FEEL SO DIZZY I TAKE A QUICK LOOK IN THE MIRROR
TO MAKE SURE MY FRIEND'S HERE WITH ME TOO
AND YOU KNOW GOOD WELL I DON'T DRINK COFFEE
SO YOU FILL MY CUP FULL OF SAND
AND THE FROZEN TEA LEAVES ON THE BOTTOM 
SHARING LIPSTICK AROUND THE BROKEN EDGE
AND MY COAT THAT YOU LET YOUR DOG LAY BY THE FIRE ON
AND YOUR CAT HE ATTACKS ME FROM HIS PIL-BOX LEDGE
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND TOO
MAN, MY SHADOW COMES IN LINE BEFORE YOU
I'M FINDING OUT THAT IT'S EH NOT SO EASY
SPECIALLY WHEN YOUR ONLY FRIEND 
TALKS, LOOKS, SEES, AND FEELS LIKE YOU
AND YOU DO THE SAME JUST LIKE HIM

LORD IT'S SO LONELY HERE HMMMM YEAH
YEAH!
PASS ME THAT BOTTLE OVER THERE
