Electric Ladyland
1983...(A MERMAN I SHOULD TURN TO BE)
HURRAY I AWAKE FROM YESTERDAY
ALIVE BUT THE WAR IS HERE TO STAY
SO MY LOVE CATHERINA AND ME
DECIDE TO TAKE OUR LAST WALK THRU THE NOISE TO THE SEA
NOT TO DIE BUT TO BE REBORN
AWAY FROM THE LANDS SO BATTRED AND TORN
FOREVER FOREVER

OH SAY CAN YOU SEE IT'S REALLY SUCH A MESS
EVERY INCH OF EARTH IS A FIGHTING NEST
GIANT PENCIL AND LIPSTICK-TUBE SHAPED THINGS
CONTINUE TO RAIN AND CAUSE SCREAMIN' PAIN
AND THE ARCTIC STAINS FROM SILVER BLUE TO BLOODY RED
AS OUR FEET FIND THE SAND 
AND THE SEA IS STRAIGHT AHAD 
STRAIGHT UP AHEAD

WELL IT'S TOO BAD THAT OUR FRIENDS CAN'T BE WITH US TODAY
WELL IT'S TOO BAD 
THE MACHINE THAT WE BUILT
WOULD NEVER SAVE US THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
THAT'S WHY THEY AIN'T COMIN' WITH US TODAY
AND THEY ALSO SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
FOR A MAN TO LIVE AND BREATHE UNDRERWATER
FOREVER WAS A MAIN COMPLAINT 
YEAH AND THEY ALSO THREW THIS IN MY FACE THEY SAID
ANYWAY YOU KNOW GOOD AND WELL 
IT WOULD BE BEYOND THE WILL OF GOD
AND THE GRACE OF THE KING
GRACE OF THE KING
YEAH

OOO

SO MY DARLING AND I MAKE LOVE IN THE SAND 
TO SALUTE THE LAST MOMENT EVER ON DRY LAND
OUR MACHINE IT HAS DONE ITS WORK PLAYED ITS PART WELL
WITHOUT A SCRATCH ON OUR BODY WHEN WE BID IT FAREWELL
STARFISH AND GIANT FOAMS GREET US WITH A SMILE 
BEFORE OUR HEADS GO UNDER WE TAKE OUR LAST LOOK AT THE KILLING NOISE
OF THE OUT OF STYLE
THE OUT OF STYLE OUT OF STYLE OH YEAH
OOOO

SO DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN WE GO
HURRY MY DARLIN' WE MUSTN'T BE LATE 
FOR THE SHOW
NEPTUNE CHAMPION GAMES TO AN AQUA WORLD IS SO MY DEAR
RIGHT THIS WAY SMILES A MERMAID
I CAN HEAR ATLANTIS FULL OF CHEER
ATLANTIS FULL OF CHEER
I CAN HEAR ATLANTIS FULL OF CHEER
OH YEAH
