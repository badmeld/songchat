Woodstock Festival
500,000 Halos ...
outshined the mud and history.
We washed and drank in
Godâ€™s tears of Joy,
And for once...and for everyone...
the truth was not a mystery--

Love called to all...Music is Magic.
As we passed over and beyond the walls of nay.
Hand in Hand as we lived and
made real the dreams of peaceful men--

We came together...Danced with
the pearls of Rainy weather
Riding the waves of music and
Space--Music is Magic...
Magic is life...
Love as never Loved Before...
Harmony to Son and Daughter...man and wife.
