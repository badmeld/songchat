Are You Experienced?
MAY THIS BE LOVE
WATERFALL 
NOTHING CAN HARM ME AT ALL
MY WORRIES SEEM SO VERY SMALL
WITH MY WATERFALL

I CAN SEE MY RAINBOW CALLING ME YEAH
THROUGH THE MISTY BREEZE OF MY WATERFALL

SOME PEOPLE SAY DAY-DREAMING IS
FOR THE ALL THE LAZY MINDED FOOLS WITH NOTHING ELSE TO DO

SO LET THEM LAUGH LAUGH AT ME
SO JUST AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU TO SEE ME THROUGH
I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE LONG AS I HAVE YOU

WATERFALL 
DON'T EVER CHANGE YOUR WAYS
FALL WITH WE FOR A MILLION DAYS
OH MY WATERFALL
