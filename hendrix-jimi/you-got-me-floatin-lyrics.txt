YOU GOT ME FLOATIN'
WELL YOU GOT ME FLOATIN' ROUND AND ROUND
ALWAYS UP YOU NEVER LET ME DOWN
THE AMAZING THING YOU TURN ME ON NATURALLY
AND I KISS YOU WHEN I PLEASE

YOU GOT ME FLOATIN' ROUND AND ROUND

HEY

TOUCH THE CEILLING
YOU GOT ME FLOATIN' NATURALLY
YOU GOT ME FLOATIN' FLOAT TO PLEASE

NOW YOU GOT ME FLOATIN' ACROSS AND THROUGH
YOU MAKE ME FLOAT RIGHT ON UP TO YOU
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I NEED TO REALLY GET ME THERE
IS TO HEAR YOU LAUGH WITH OUT A CARE
WHAT I SAY NOW

NOW YOUR DADDY'S COOL AND YOUR MAMMA'S NO FOOL
THEY BOTH KNOW I'M HEADS OVER HEELS FOR YOU
AND WHEN THE DAY MELTS DOWN INTO A SLEEPY RED GLOW
THAT'S WHEN MY DESIRES START TO SHOW

YOU GOT ME FLOATIN' 
HEY HEY
YOU GOT ME FLOATIN' 
JUST YOUR STYLE
YOU GOT ME FLOATIN' 
YOU GOT ME FLOATIN' 
HEY HEY
