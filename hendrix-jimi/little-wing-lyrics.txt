LITTLE WING
WELL SHE'S WALKING, THROUGH THE CLOUDS
WITH A CIRCUS MIND THAT'S RUNNING WILD
BUTTERFLIES AND ZEBRAS
AND MOONBEAMS AND A FAIRY TALES
THAT'S ALL SHE EVER THINKS ABOUT
RIDING WITH THE WIND

WHEN I'M SAD SHE COMES TO ME
WITH A THOUSAND SMILES SHE GIVES TO ME FREE
IT'S ALRIGHT SHE SAYS, IT'S ALRIGHT
TAKE ANYTHING YOU WANT FROM ME 
ANYTHING

FLY ON LITTLE WING
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
FLY ON LITTLE WING
