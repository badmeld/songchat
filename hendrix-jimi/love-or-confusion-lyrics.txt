Are You Experienced?
LOVE OR CONFUSION
IS THAT THE STARS IN THE SKY OR IS IT RAINING FALLIN DOWN?
WILL IT BURN ME IT I TOUCH THE SUN, YEAH
SO BIT SO ROUND?
WILL I BE TRUTHFUL, YEAH
IN A, CHOOSING YOU AS THE ONE FOR ME?

IS THIS LOVE BABY
OR IS IT A, JUST CONFUSION?

OH, MY MIND IS SO MIXED UP GOIN' ROUND 'N' ROUND
MUST THERE BE ALL THESE COLORS WITHOUT NAMES
WITHOUT SOUNDS? BABE
MY HEART BURNS WITH FEELIN' BUT
OH BUT MY MIND IS COLD AND REELING
IS THIS LOVE, BABY 
OR IS IT CONFUSION?

OH MY HEAD IS POUNDING POUNDING
GOING 'ROUND AND 'ROUND AND 'ROUND AND 'ROUND
MUST THERE ALWAYS BE THESE COLORS? 
WITHOUT NAMES WITHOUT SOUND? 
MY HEART BURNS WITH FEELIN' BUT
OH BUT MY MIND IS COLD AND REELING
IS THIS LOVE, OR IS IT JUST CONFUSION?

AH YOU TELL ME BABY 
IS THIS LOVE OR CONFUSION
WE MUST GET TOGETHER AND FIND OUT
