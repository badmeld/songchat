BELLY BUTTON WINDOW
WELL I'M UP HERE IN THIS WOMB 
I'M LOOKIN' ALL AROUND
HMM MM MM
WELL I'M LOOKIN' OUT MY BELLY BUTTON WINDOW
AND I SEE A WHOLE LOT OF FROWNS
AND I'M WONDERIN' IF THEY DON'T WANT ME, AROUND

WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE FUSS OUT THERE
JUST WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE HANG
CAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T WANT ME THIS TIME AROUND
YEAH, I'LL BE GLAD TO GO BACK TO SPIRIT LAND
AND EVEN TAKE A LONGER REST
BEFORE A COMIN' DOWN THE SHOOT AGAIN
MAN I SURE REMEMBER THE LAST TIME, BABY
THEY WERE STILL TALKIN' ABOUT ME THEN
SO IF YOU DON'T WANT ME NOW
MAKE UP YOUR MIND
WHERE OR WHEN
MAKE UP YOUR MIND
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME NOW
GIVE OR TAKE
YOU ONLY GOT TWO-HUNDRED DAYS
CAUSE I AIN'T COMIN' DOWN THIS WAY TOO MUCH MORE, AGAIN

YOU KNOW THEY GOT PILLS FOR ILLS, AND THRILLS, AND EVEN SPILLS
BUT I THINK YOUR JUST A LITTLE TOO LATE
SO I'M COMIN' DOWN INTO THIS WORLD DADDY
REGARDLESS OF LOVE AND HATE
I'M GONNA SIT UP IN YOUR BED MAMMA 
AND JUST A GRIN RIGHT IN YOUR FACE
AND THEN I'M GONNA EAT UP ALL YOUR CHOCOLATES
HA, AND SAY I HOPE I'M NOT TOO LATE

IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS MAKE UP YOUR MIND
GIVE OR TAKE
IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS MAKE UP YOUR MIND
GIVE OR TAKE
YOU GOT ONLY TWO-HUNDRED DAYS

AND I'M LOOKIN' OUT MY BELLY BUTTON WINDOW
AND I SWARE I SEE NOTHING BUT A LOT OF FROWNS
AND I WON'T LIVE IF THEY DON'T WANT ME, AROUND
