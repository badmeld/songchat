Are You Experienced?
I DON'T LIVE TODAY
WILL I LIVE TOMORROW?
WELL I JUST CAN'T SAY
WILL I LIVE TOMORROW?
WELL I JUST CAN'T SAY
BUT I KNOW FOR SURE 
I DON'T LIVE TODAY

NO SUN COMIN' THROUGH MY WINDOWS
FEEL LIKE I'M LIVIN' AT THE BOTTOM OF A GRAVE
NO SUN COMIN'THROUGH MY WINDOWS
FEEL LIKE I'M LIVIN' AT THE BOTTOM OF A GRAVE

I WISH YOU'D HURRY UP AND EXICUTE ME
SO I CAN BE ON MY MISERABLE WAY

I DON'T, LIVE TODAY
MAYBE TOMORROW, I JUST CAN SAY
BUT A, I DON'T LIVE TODAY 
IT'S SUCH A SHAME TO WAST YOU TIME AWAY LIKE THIS

WELL 
I DON'T LIVE TODAY
MAYBE TOMORROW, I JUST CAN'T TELL YOU BABY
BUT A, I DON'T LIVE TODAY
IT'S SUCH A SHAME SPENDED THE TIME AWAY LIKE THIS

YEAH!!

THERE AIN'T NO LIFE NO WHERE
