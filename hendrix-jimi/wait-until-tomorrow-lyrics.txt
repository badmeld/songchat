WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW
WELL I'M STANDING HERE FREEZING
INSIDE YOUR GOLDEN GARDEN
GOT MY LADDER LEANED UP AGAINST YOUR WALL
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT WE PLANED TO RUN AWAY TOGETHER
COME ON DOLLY MAE THERE'S NO TIME TO STALL
BUT NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME 
I THINK WE BETTER WAIT 'TILL TOMORROW
YEAH, YEAH,
I THINK WE BETTER WAIT 'TILL TOMORROW
GIRL WHAT YOU TALKEN ABOUT
I THINK WE BETTER WAIT 'TILL TOMORROW

GOT TO MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT
SO UNTILL TOMORROW GOODNIGHT
OH WHAT A DRAG

OH DOLLY MAE, HOW CAN YOU HANG WE OUT THIS WAY
ON THE PHONE YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO RUN OFF WITH ME TODAY
NOW I'M SANDING HERE LIKE SOME
TURNED DOWN SERENDADING FOOL
HEARING STRANGE WORDS STUTTER FROM THE MIXED-UP MIND OF YOU
AND YOU KEEP TELLING ME THAT AH
I THINK WE BETTER WAIT TILL TOMORROW, 
WHAT ARE YOU TALKEN ABOUT
I THINK WE BETTER WAIT TILL TOMORROW
AH, I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG
I THINK WE BETTER WAIT TILL TOMORROW

GOT TO MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT
SO UNTILL TOMORROW GOODNIGHT
SEE IF I CAN TALK TO THIS GIRL A LITTLE BIT

OH DOLLY MAE GIRL YOU MUST BE INSANE
SO UNSURE OF YOURSELF
LEANING FROM YOU UNSURE WINDOW PANE
DO I SEE A SILHOUETTE OF SOMEBODY POINTING
SOMETHING FROM A TREE
CLICK BANG
OH WHAT A HANG YOUR DADDY JUST SHOT POOR ME
AND I HEAR YOU SAY AS I FADE AWAY

WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL TOMORROW
