ASTRO MAN
HERE I COME TO SAVE THE DAY

A LITTLE BOY INSIDE A DREAM JUST THE OTHER DAY
HIS MIND FELL OUT OF HIS FACE AND THE WIND BLEW IT AWAY
A HAND CAME OUT AND HAPPENED TO PIN THAT BAGGE ON HIS CHEST
IT SAID GET OUT THERE MAN AND A DO YOUR BEST

AND HE'S CALLED THE ASTRO MAN
AND HE'S FLIN' HIGHER THAN
THAT OLD FAGGOT SUPERMAN
EVER COULD

OH, THEY CALL HIM COSMIC NUT
AND HE'S TWICE AS DENCE AS DONALD DUCK
AND HE'LL TRY HIS BEST TO SCREW YOU UP
THE REST OF YOUR MIND
OH, LOOK OUT, MY GUITARS

ASTRO MAN, FLYIN' ACROSS THE SKY
TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN
THAT OLD FAGGOT SUPERMAN
EVER, EVER COULD
EVER COULD

THERE HE GOES, THERE HE GOES
WHERE HE STOPS, NO ONE KNOWS
THER HE GOES, THERE HE GOES, UH
HE'S TRYIN' TO, TRYIN' TO BLOW OUT THE REST OF YOUR MIND
HE'S GONNA BLOW OUT THE REST OF YOUR MIND
TALKIN' ABOUT LOOKIN FOR PEACE OF MIND
ASTRO MAN WILL LEAVE IT IN PIECES
HAVE YOU PUT OUR TROUBLE BEHIND HIM
MAKE YOU FLY AROUND IN PIECES
YEAH, BLOW OUT THE REST OF YOUR MIND
ASTRO MAN WILL BLOW OUT THE REST OF YOUR MIND
HE'S GONNA BLOW OUT THE REST OF YOUR MIND
OOO-HOO
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
BLOW OUT THE REST OF OF YOUR MIND
