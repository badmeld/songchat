SPANISH CASTLE MAGIC
IT'S VERY FAR AWAY
IT TAKES ABOUT HALF A DAY
TO GET THERE 
IF WE TRAVEL BY MY....DRAGONFLY

NO IT'S NOT IN SPAIN 
BUT ALL THE SAME 
YOU KNOW
IT'S A GOOVY NAME
AND THE WIND'S JUST RIGHT
HEY

HANG ON MY DARLING
HANG ON IF YOU WANT TO GO
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY GROOVY PLACE 
AND IT'S JUST A LIITLE BIT OF A SPANISH CASTLE MAGIC

THE CLOUDS ARE REALLY LOW
AND THEY OVERFLOW 
WITH COTTON CANDY 
AND BATTLE GROUNDS
RED AND BROWN

BUT IT'S ALL IN YOUR MIND 
DON'T THINK YOUR TIME
ON BAD THINGS
JUST FLOAT YOUR LITTLE MIND AROUND
LOOK OUT

HANG ON MY DARLING YEAH
HANG ON IF YOU WANT TO GO
IT PUTS EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE SHELF
WITH JUST A LITLLE BIT OF SPANISH CASTLE MAGIC
YEAH BABY 


HANG ON MY DARLING YEAH
HANG ON, HANG ON IF YOU WANT TO GO 
IT PUTS EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE SHELF
WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SPANISH CASTLE MAGIC
HEY 
ITS ALL IN YOUR MIND
A LITTLE BIT OF DAYDREAM HERE AND THERE
