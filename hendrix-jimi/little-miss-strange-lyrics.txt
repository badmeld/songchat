LITTLE MISS STRANGE
NO ONE KNOWS WHERE SHE COMES FROM
MAYBE SHE'S A DEVIL IN DISGUISE 
I CAN'T TELL BY LOOKIN' IN HER EYES

LITTLE MISS STRANGE
LITTLE MISS STRANGE
LITTLE MISS STRANGE CAME INTO MY PARLOR
I DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHAT TO ASK HER
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT WE DID AFTER 

LITTLE MISS STRANGE
LITTLE MISS STRANGE

LITTLE MISS STRANGE CAME OUT OF THE DARKNESS
WALKED ACROSS MY HEAD 
STOOD BENEATH THE LIGHT
I TOLD HER ABOUT THE DREAM I HAD THE OTHER NIGHT

LITTLE MISS STRANGE
