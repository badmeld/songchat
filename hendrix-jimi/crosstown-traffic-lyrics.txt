CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC
YOU JUMP IN FRONT OF MY CAR 
WHEN YA KNOW ALL THE TIME 
90 MILES AN HOUR GIRL IS THE SPEED I DRIVE 
YOU TELL ME IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YOU DON'T MIND A LITTLE PAIN
YOU SAY YOU JUST WANT ME TO TAKE YOU FOR A DRIVE
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC
IT'S SO HARD TO GET THROUGH TO YOU 
CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC
I DON'T NEED TO RUN OVER YOU
CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC
ALL YOU DO IS SLOW ME DOWN
I'M TRYIN' TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN

I'M NOT THE ONLY SOUL WHO'S ACCUSED OF HIT AND RUN 
TIRE TRACKS ALL ACROSS ALL YOUR BACK
I CAN I CAN SEE YOU HAD YOUR FUN 
BUT A 
DARLIN' CAN'T YOU SEE MY SIGNALS TURN FORM GREEN TO RED
AND WITH YOU I CAN SEE A TRAFFIC JAM
STRAIT UP AHEAD
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC
IT'S SO HARD TO GET THROUGH TO YOU 
CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC
I DON'T NEED TO RUN OVER YOU
CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC
ALL YOU DO IS SLOW ME DOWN
AND I GOT BETTER THINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN
