EVERYDAY IN THE WEEK I'M IN A DIFFERNET CITY

THEY TALK ABOUT ME LIKE A DOG
TALKIN' ABOUT THE CLOTHES I WEAR
BUT THEY DON'T REALISE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO'S SQUARE

HEY!

YOU CAN'T HOLD ME DOWN
I DON'T WANT TO BE DOWN I GOTTA MOVE

A WOMAN HERE A WOMAN THERE TRY TO KEEP ME IN A PLASTIC CAGE
BUT THEY DON'T REALISE IT'S SO EASY TO BREAK
