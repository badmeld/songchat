ANGEL
ANGEL CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN, YESTERDAY
SHE STAYED WITH ME JUST LONG ENOUGH TO RESCUE ME
AND SHE TOLD ME A STORY YESTERDAY
ABOUT THE SWEET LOVE BETWEEN THE MOON AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA
AND THEN SHE SPREAD HER WINGS HIGH OVER ME
SHE SAID SHE'S GOING TO COME BACK TOMORROW

AND I SAID FLY ON MY SWEET ANGEL
FLY ON THROUGH THE SKY
FLY ON MY SWEET ANGEL
TOMORROW I'M GONNA BE BY YOUR SIDE

SURE ENOUGH THIS MORNIN' CAME UNTO ME 
SILVER WINGS SILHOUETTED AGAINST A CHILD'S SUNRISE 
AND MY ANGEL SHE SAID UNTO ME
"TODAY IS THE DAY FOR YOU TO RISE
TAKE MY HAND YOUR GOIN' BE MY MAN, YOUR GOIN' RISE"
AND THEN SHE TAKE ME HIGH OVER YONDER

AND I SAID FLY ON MY SWEET ANGEL
FLY ON THROUGH THE SKY
FLY ON MY SWEET ANGEL
FOREVER I'M GONNA BE BY YOUR SIDE
