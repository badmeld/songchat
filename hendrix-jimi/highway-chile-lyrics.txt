Hendrix Jimi
Are You Experienced?
HIGHWAY CHILE
YEAH
HIS GUITAR SWUNG ACROSS HIS BACK
HIS DUSTY BOOTS AND ITS HIS CADILLAC
A FLAMIN' HEAD JUST A BLOWIN' IN THE WIND
AIN'T SEE A BED IN SO LONG IT'S A SIN

HE LEFT HOME WHEN HE WAS SEVENTEEN
THE REST OF THE WORLD HE LONGED TO SEE
AND EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS WAS BOSS
A ROLLING STONE GATHERS NO MOSS

NOW YOU PROBABLY CALL HIM A TRAMP 
BUT IT GOES A LITTLE DEEPPER THAN THAT
HE'S A HIGHWAY CHILE

YEAH
NOW SOME PEOPLE SAY HE HAD A GIRL BACK HOME 
WHO MESSED HIM AROOUND AND DID HIM PRETTY WRONG
THEY TELL ME IT KINDA HURT HIM BAD
KINDA MADE HIM FEEL PRETTY SAD

I COULDN'T SAY WHAT WENT THRU HIS MIND
ANYWAY HE LEFT THE WORLD BEHIND
AND EVERBODY KNOWS THE SAME OLD STORY
ANOTHER WAR YOU CAN'T LOSE IN GOLORY

NOW YOU MAY CALL HIM A TRAMP 
BUT IT GOWAS A LITTLE DEEPER THAN THAT
HE'S A HIGHWAY CHILE
ONE MORE BROTHER
YEAH!

HIS GUITAR SWUNG ACROSS HIS BACK
HIS DUSTY BOOTS AND HIS HIS CADILLAC
A PAVEMENT HERE JUST A BLOWIN' IN THE WIND
AIN'T SEE A BED IN SO LONG IT'S A SIN

NOW YOU MAY CALL HIM A TRAMP 
BUT I KNOW IT GO WAS A LITTLE DEPPER THAN THAT
HE'S A HIGHWAY CHILE
WALK ON BROTHER
DON'T LET NO ONE STOP YA

YEAH 
HIGHWAY CHILE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
GO ON DOWN THE HIGHWAY
HIGHWAY CHILE
