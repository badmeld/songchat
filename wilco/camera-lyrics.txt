I need a camera
To my eye
To my eye, reminding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong

I'm counting out
The days in Central Park
With gravel in my heart
With echoes in my palm

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay

I smashed a camera
I wanna know why
To my eyes, reminding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong

I'm counting on
The days to see how far
I've driven in the dark
With gravel in my heart

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay

I'm counting on
Those days in Central Park
With echoes in my heart
With gravel in my palm

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no it's not okay

No, it's not okay
No, it's not okay
