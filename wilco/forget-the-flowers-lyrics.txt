You're tryin' my patience
Try pink carnations
Red roses and yellow daffodils
Don't forget the flowers, someday
I know you will

Displayers of affection
And all good intentions
Why don't you just send me the bill?
Don't forget the flowers, someday
I know you will

Whether you've been takin' me
Way too seriously, ooh
I can't ever explain
Why, I don't feel the pain, ooh

I left you behind
I know it's been a long time
But I'm not over you
Don't forget the flowers, someday
I hope I do

Tryin' my patience
Try pink carnations
Red roses and yellow daffodils
Don't forget the flowers, someday
I know I will

Don't forget the flowers, someday
I know I will
