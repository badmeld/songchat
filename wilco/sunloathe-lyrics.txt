Allo Sun
Sometimes I don't
Know how to love
Anything myself
It's hard
To become
Hold on to it all
But kill my memories
with a cheap
Disease

To the sails
Fail
To the bird
and the whale
Remove my misery
It's all or nothing
I see
I don't wanna lose this fight
I don't wanna end this fight
Goodbye

Allo
The Sun
Someday I know
I'll learn
How to love
Anymore is enough
I don't want to lose this fight
I don't want end this fight
Goodbye
