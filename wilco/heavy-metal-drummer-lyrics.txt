Well I sincerely miss those Heavy Metal Bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love

Shiny, shiny pants and bleach blonde hair
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
Another then another
She fell in love

I miss the innocence I've known
(Ooo hey)
Playin' Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
(Ooo hey)

Unlock my body and move myself to dance
Give me warm liquid, flowing glowing glass
Classical music blasting masks
The ringing in my ears

Oh I sincerely miss those Heavy Metal Bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with another
She fell in love

I miss the innocence I've known
(Ooo hey)
Playin' Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
(Ooo hey)
I miss the innocence I've known
(Ooo hey)
Playin' Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
(Ooo hey)

Playin' Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
(Ooo hey)
Playin' Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
(Ooo ooo)
(Ooo hey)
(Ooo ooo)
(Ooo hey)
