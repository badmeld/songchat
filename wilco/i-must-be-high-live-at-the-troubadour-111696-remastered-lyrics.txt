You
Always wanted more time
To do what you
Always wanted to do

Now you got it and I
I must be high
To say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye

You
Never said you needed this
You're pissed that you missed
The very last kiss

From my lips and I
I must be high
To say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye

You
Never looked in my eyes
Long enough to find
Any peace of mind

But now you got it and I
I must be high
To let you say goodbye
I must be high

Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
