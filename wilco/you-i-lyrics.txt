You and I, we might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met

But you and I, I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but

You and I, you and I

Me and you, what can we do
When the words we use sometimes
Are misconstrued

Well, I won't guess what's coming next
I can't ever tell you
The deepest well I've ever fallen into

Oh, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't need to know
Everything about you

Oh, I don't wanna know
And you don't need to know
That much about me

You and I, we might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met

But you and I, I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but

You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
