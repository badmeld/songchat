One, two, three

She's the only one I get up for
Go down the station she's waiting there
Myrna lee, I'm alone in the city

I saw vision of Myrna Lee
In a foggy dark window
Myrna Lee, the way it was for me

You're the only one I've waited for all this time
Myrna Lee, we're together you and me

She could bring out the good in things
The way her mama tells her little kid
Myrna Lee, bring that way to me

I knew it when I found the rest of the crowd
Scattered around in pieces
Myrna Lee, keep 'em away from me

You're the only one I've waited for all this time
Myrna Lee, we're together you and me

You're the only one I've waited for all this time
Myrna Lee, we're together you and me
Myrna Lee, we're together you and me
