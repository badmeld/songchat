I, i shouldve been listening
to every word you said
oh, what have i been missing
wishing, wishing that you were dead
I didn't mean to be so disturbing
so far from home
oh, what have i been learning
by being all alone
Every little thing
every little thing
every little thing
(is gonna) just tears you apart
Every little thing
every little thing
every little thing
(is gonna) just tears you apart
When, when we were younger
sleep while i'm awake
i was trying to keep the door locked
i realize thats a mistake
Every little thing
every little thing
every little thing
is gonna tear you apart
Every little thing
every little thing
every little thing
is gonna tear you apart
Every little thing that you do
seems so much better than i could do
oh, i shouldve been listening
to every word you said
Every little thing
every little thing
every little thing
is gonna tear you apart
Every little thing
every little thing
every little thing
is gonna tear you apart (it's gonna)
Every little thing (it's gonna)
every little thing (it's gonna)
every little thing (it's gonna)
is gonna tear you apart
Every little thing (it's gonna)
every little thing (it's gonna)
every little thing (it's gonna)
is gonna tear you apart
It's gonna
it's gonna
it's gonna tear you apart
It's gonna
it's gonna
it's gonna tear you apart
