All I can see is black and white and white and pink with blades of blue
That lay between the words I think on a page I was meaning to send
You, I couldn't tell if it bring my heart the way I wanted
When I started writing this letter to you

And if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand
I'm the man who loves you

All I can be is a busy sea of spinning wheels and hands that feel
For stones to throw and feet that run but they come back home
And make no difference ever known
Make no difference ever known to me

And if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand
I'm the man who loves you

All I can see is black and white and white and pink with blades of blue
That lay between the words I think on a page I was meaning to send
You, I couldn't tell if it bring my heart the way I wanted
When I started writing this letter to you

If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand
If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand
If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand

I'm the man who loves you
I'm the man who loves you
I'm the man who loves you
I'm the man who loves you
