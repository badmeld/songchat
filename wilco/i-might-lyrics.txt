Was I wrong? Off all night long?
So high, as the stinking sun
I came alive, then I felt, Oh Uh Oh

Some guys have everything I know
It’s alright
I’ve done a lot of crawling around outside
(and I heard) It’s alright

Your sno-cone, and it’s piss and blood
It’s in the cards (oh, oh) 'Get Well Soon
Everybody
Do all lies have a taste?
Let it go, I don’t know oh
A cow’s neck, bad shave, in the low blow slo-mo

It’s alright
You won’t set the kids on fire
Oh but I might
Oh

You come on, sentimental
If the solar car’s coming, I’m home
The Magna Carta’s on a Slim Jim blood, Brutha!
The sunk soul with the coal clean toe, is the mutha!

Yea. That’s right
When you gonna find out
I’m all inside
You still might

It’s all right
It’s all right

It’s alright
You won’t set the kids on fire
Oh but I might
Oh

It’s all right
It’s all right
