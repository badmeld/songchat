Come on, children
You're acting like children
Every generation thinks
It's the end of the world

All you fat followers
Get fit fast
Every generation thinks it's the last
Thinks it's the end of the world

Yes, dream down a well
There's a lone heavy hell
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore

It's a feeling we transcend
That we're here at the end
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore

You never know

Come on, kids
You're acting like children
Act your age
Put back the black metals and pearls

Oh, all you sword swallowers
Pull yourselves together
Every generation thinks it's the worst
Thinks it's the end of the world

It's a secret I can't tell
There's a wish down a well
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore

It's a long heavy hell
Super size it by ten
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore

You never know
I will never know

I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore

It's a secret I can't tell
There's a wish down a well
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore

It's a dear to transcend
And we're here at the end
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore

You never know
Oh, you never know
