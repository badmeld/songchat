I wanna be your kingpin, living in Pekin
I wanna be your bigwig, living in Pekin
I caught the flu and away I flew

N.Y.C., pediate blue
Dime tap and spinal tap
City maps and hand claps

Statue of liberty play
It only works once
Don't throw it away

'Cause I wanna be your kingpin, living in Pekin
Living' in Pekin, livin' in
How can I, how can I give my love to you
When I don't know what to do?
