Tires type black
Where the blacktop cracks
Weeds spark through
Dark green enough to be blue

When the mysteries we believe in
Aren't dreamed enough to be true
Some side with the leaves
Some side with the seeds

The treetops nod, the rain applauds
The park grows dark
And the swings all slowly die

But you and I will be undefeated
By agreeing to disagree
No one wins but the thieves
So why side with anything?

The streetlights glow
Comes and goes
When the sun comes back
As we all can plainly see

Embracing the situation
Is our only chance to be free
Oh, I'll side with you
If you side with me
