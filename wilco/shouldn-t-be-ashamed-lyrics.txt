To live without a savior, answer to his name
You shouldn't be afraid, you shouldn't be ashamed
Like a kid behind the counter remembering your name
You shouldn't be afraid, you shouldn't be ashamed

If it's not like I told you, then it's still your call
You should live how you want
Stay with me, we should stay apart
Just shouldn't ever have to be this hard

Like a man on the sidewalk remembering your face
You shouldn't look away, you shouldn't be afraid
He remembers when they still wore gaiters, World War One
You shouldn't be afraid, you shouldn't be ashamed

If it's not like I told you, then it's still your call
You should live how you want
Stay with me, we should stay apart
Just shouldn't ever have to be this hard
