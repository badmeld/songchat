Black wind blowing in the cotton field, honey
There's a black wind blowing in the cotton field, baby
There's a black wind blowing in the cotton field
And oh how funny it makes me feel
Baby, sweet thing, darling

There's a long black cloud hanging in the sky, honey
There's a long black cloud hanging in the sky, baby
There's a long black cloud hanging in the sky
Weather's gonna break and hells gonna fly
Baby, sweet thing, darling

Cotton's pretty thin yonder on the hill, honey
Cotton's pretty thin yonder on the hill, baby
Cotton's pretty thin yonder on the hill
It won't clear a greenback dollar bill
Baby, sweet thing, darling

Work shade and back to the buzzard wing, honey
Work shade and back to the buzzard wing, baby
Work shade and back to the buzzard wing
Clouds are gonna bust and cry down rain
Baby, sweet thing, darling

There's a black wind blowing in the cotton field, honey
There's a black wind blowing in the cotton field, baby
There's a black wind blowing in the cotton field
And oh how funny it makes me feel
Baby, sweet thing, darling
