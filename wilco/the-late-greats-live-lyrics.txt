The greatest lost track of all time
The late greats', "Turpentine"
You can't hear it on the radio
You can't hear it anywhere you go

The best band will never get signed
K-Settes starring Butcher's blind
Are so good, you won't ever know
They never even played a show
You can't hear 'em on the radio

The greatest singer in rock and roll
Would have to be Romeo
His vocal chords are made of gold
He just looks a little too old

The best song will never get sung
The best laugh never leaves your lungs
So good, you won't ever know
You can't hear it on the radio
You can't hear it on the radio
