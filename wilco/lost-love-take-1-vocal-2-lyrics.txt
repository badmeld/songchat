Lost love in the desert
Lost love on the sea
You can put it behind you
But it's still beyond me

Hearts break in the summer
They will meet me in the spring
Broken hearts all around me
But I don't feel a thing

Lost love on the highway
Lost love on the phone
Lost love with a suitcase
Heading back home

Hearts break in the summer
They will meet me in the spring
Mines still wrapped inside me
And it still stands

You're my lost love, I can't see
That you're coming back for me
I'm the travel, you can't find
And it's only a matter of time

Should have taken it all so hard
Should have taken it all so hard
