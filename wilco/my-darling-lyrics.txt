Go back to sleep now my darlin'
And I'll keep all the bad dreams away
Breathe now, think sweet things
And I'll think of all the right words to say

Because we made you, my darlin'
With the love in each of our hearts
We were a family, my darlin' right from the start

Grow up now, my darlin'
Please don't you grow up too fast
And be sure, darlin'
To make all the good times last

Because we made you, my darlin'
With the love in each of our hearts
We were a family, my darlin' right from the start
