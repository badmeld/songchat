Got you and it's all I need
Got you and it's all I need
Got you and it's all I need, got you

I got you and I still believe
That you're all I'll ever need
It's you all

All the way back in the seventies
You were my little T.V queen
Your Tarzan and your friend Janine, got you

I got you and I still believe
That you're all I'll ever need
It's you all

It's the end of the century
I can't think of anything
Except you

It's the end of the century
And I can't think of anything
But you, all, all I need

I got you, I got you, babe
I got you, you
I got you, I got you, I got you
