Let's have Christ our President 
Let us have him for our king 
Cast your vote for the Carpenter 
That they call the Nazarene 

The only way 
We could ever beat 
These crooked politician men 

Is to cast the moneychangers 
Out of the temple 
Put the Carpenter in 

Oh it's Jesus Christ our President 
God above our king 
With a job and pension for young and old 
We will make hallelujah ring 

Every year we waste enough 
To feed the ones who starve 
We build our civilization up 
And we shoot it down with wars 

But with the Carpenter 
On the seat 
Way up in the capitol town 

The USA 
Be on the way 
Prosperity bound
