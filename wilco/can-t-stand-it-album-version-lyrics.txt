The way things go, you get so low
Struggle to find your skin
Well hey ho, look out below
Your prayers will never be answered again

Phones still ring and singers sing
Speakers are speaking in code
What now, well anyhow
Our prayers will never be answered again

You know it's all beginning
To feel like it's ending
No love's as random as God's love
I can't stand it, I can't stand it

The way things get, you get so high
Funny how we make new friends
Well hey ho, I gotta go
My prayers will never be answered again

You know it's all beginning
To feel like it's ending
No love's as random as God's love
I can't stand it, I can't stand it

Speakers singing, speakers speaking
Speaking in code
Speakers singing, speakers speaking
Speaking in code

You know it's all beginning
To feel like pretending
No love's as random as my love
I can't stand it, I can't stand it

Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
