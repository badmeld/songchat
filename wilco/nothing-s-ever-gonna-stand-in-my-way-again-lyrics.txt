Nothing's Ever Gonna Stand In My Way Again
Well find a way regardless
To make some sense out of this mess
Well, It's a test, but I believe
A kiss is all we need
All the above for being in love
Shouldnt that alone be enough
Oh, It's tough when loves a weed
It grows inside of me

Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again

Waste the days, waste the nights
Try to downplay being uptight
Oh, you're right, but I believe
A kiss is all we need

Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again

A watch that ticks is wrapped around my wrist
(Oh no)
I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh) I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh) I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh) I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh)

Well find a way
Well find a way
Well find a way

Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again

Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again
