Cheer up, Honey I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stuff
Honey kisses, clouds of fluff
Shoulders shrugging off

Cheer up, Honey I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with radio cures
Electronic surgical words

Picking apples for the kings and queens
Of things I've never seen
Oh, distance has no way
Making love understandable

Cheer up, Honey I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stars
Honey kisses, clouds of love

Picking apples for the kings and queens
Of things I've never seen
Oh, distance has no way
Making love understandable
Oh, distance has no way
Making love understandable
Oh, distance has no way
Making love understandable
Ow, distance has no way
Making love understandable

Cheer up, Honey I hope you can
