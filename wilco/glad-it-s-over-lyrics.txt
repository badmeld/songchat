I don't feel bad
I don't feel lonely
I'm just glad it's over

I don't need your love, I don't want it
Heaven is up above
And I'm upon it without you, without you

I don't want to kiss you again can you believe it?
I don't want to be your friend
I just want you out of my life until my life ends, oh yeah

I don't feel bad
I don't feel lonely
I'm just glad it's over

I know you think I'm weak, I'll tell you something
It's better we don't speak
I got nothing to say to you, anyway

I've said what I meant to put it mildly
I hate you 100 per cent, I mean that kindly
Oh you're not for me, not for me

I don't feel bad
You're not the only one I ever had
I don't feel sad
I don't feel lonely
Not even sorry
I'm just glad it's over

I'm out playing with you
You're just getting your dues
Oh, it's true, it's true, I'm just glad it's over

Oh, I'm sorry, I ran, I didn't mean it
Let's get back where we began
Stop screaming, I want you back in my arms
Everyday after today

Don't feel bad
You know, I'm sorry
Just be glad it's over
Don't feel sad
We all have to be lonely
Just be glad it's over
I'm just glad it's over
