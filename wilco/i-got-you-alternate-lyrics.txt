Got you and it's all I need
Got you and it's all I need
Got you and it's all I need
I got you
I got you and I still believe
That you're all that I'll ever need
It's you

All
All the way back in the seventies
You were my little t.v. queen
Y'er tarzan and friend Janine
I got you
I got you and I still believe
That you're all that I'll ever need
It's you
All

It's the end of the century
I can't think of anything
Except you
It's the end of the century
And I can't think of anything
But you
All
All
I
Need
