Sunlight angles on
Wooden floor at dawn
A ceiling fan is on
Chopping up my dreams

What is left of them
I take to sleep again
Where I dare pretend
I'm more than I seem

Tears get triggered
Yours remind me
Of the ice
Melting in my glass

Finally full again
So I listen for
Your lips to break apart
Into words

It definitely starts to spoil my heart
Well, somewhere there's a war
Well, sometimes there's art

It definitely starts to spoil my heart
Somewhere there's a war
And sometimes there's art

When I'm awake enough
I'm gonna shake it off
Gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off

Oh, shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off

Hotels hold me
Thoughts arouse in
So many hearts
Beating in one place

Like a giant
Beast with many souls
No, just a body
Full of holes

When I'm awake enough
I'm gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off

When I'm awake enough
I'm gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off
I'm gonna shake it off

I'm gonna shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
