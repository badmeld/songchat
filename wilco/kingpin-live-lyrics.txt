I wanna be your kingpin
Living in Pekin
I wanna be your bigwig
Living in Pekin

I caught the flu and away I flew
NYC, pediate blue
Dimeatap and spinal tap
City maps and hand claps

Statue of liberty play
It only works once
Don't throw it away

'Cause I wanna be your kingpin
Living in Pekin
Livin' in Pekin
Livin' in

How can I, how can I give my love to you
When I don't know what to do?
