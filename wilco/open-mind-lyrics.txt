I will throw myself underneath the wheels of any train of thought
running off the rails I'll sail you through the rogue waves of your brain

If I could bring a light to shine upon the dark and disobeying
night so young but I still say we're too old for cliches

Oh I can only dream of the dreams we'd share 
if you were so inclined
I would love to be the one to open up your mind

I could base my whole existence upon the cherry-strands of your gold hair
I would ask, almost insist upon treating you kind and fair

Oh I can only dream of the dreams we'd have if our hearts would be entwined
If you would let me be the one to open up your mind

I'd still be myself beneath the banks all broken beside the stream
ready to return your thoughts unlearned so it goes, 
so it seems

Oh I can only dream of the dreams we'd share if you weren't so defined
I would love to be the one to open up your mind

If you would let me be the one to open up your mind
