Crazy rides rockets
Who has a magic wand
Empty out your pockets
Words without a song

I myself have found, real rival in myself
I am hoping for, re arrival of my health

Sleep eye sockets
Baby suck your thumb
I'll keep you in my locket
A string I never strum

It's become so obvious
You are so oblivious to yourself

You're tied in a knot
But I'm not, gonna get caught
Callin' a pot kettle black
Every song's a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later

Lazy locomotives
Wherever you may roll
I think you have no motive
I know you have no home

It's become so obvious
You are so oblivious to yourself

You're tied in a knot
But I'm not, gonna get caught
Callin' a pot kettle black
Every song's a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later

You're tied in a knot
But I'm not, gonna get caught
Callin' a pot kettle black
I'm not, gonna get caught
Callin' a pot kettle black
Oh oh oh oh
