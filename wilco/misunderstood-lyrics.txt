You're back in your old neighborhood
Cigarettes taste so good
But you're so misunderstood
So misunderstood

There's somethin' there that you can't find
Honest when you're tellin' a lie
You're hurt but you don't know why?
You love her but you don't know why?

Short on long term goals
There's a party there that we oughta go to
Do you still love rock and roll?
Do you still love rock and roll?

It's only a quarter to three
Reflecting off the O.C.D.
You're lookin' at a picture of me
You're starin' at a picture of me

Take the guitar player for a ride
'Cause he ain't never been satisfied
He thinks he owes some kind of debt
Be years before he gets over it

There's a fortune inside your head
All you touch turns to lead
You think you might just crawl back in bed
The fortune inside your head

You know you're just a mama's boy
Positively unemployed
So misunderstood
So misunderstood

I know you gotta God shaped hole
Leanin' out your [Incomprehensible]
So misunderstood, so misunderstood
So misunderstood, so misunderstood

I'd like to thank you all for nothin'
I'd like to thank you all for nothin' at all
I'd like to thank you all for nothin'

Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin' at all
Nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin' at all
