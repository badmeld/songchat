Comment (If All Men Are Truly Brothers)
Originally by Charles Wright

Watch out for your friends
Well they may lose in the end
Sometimes their child can make you sin
What is a man without a friend?
We all live within a game
The word 'excuse' has many names
Where true friends really come
You can't afford to lose one

If all men were truly brothers
Why then do we hurt one another?
Love and peace from ocean to ocean
Somebody please second my emotion!
All men were born to be free, yeah
What about you? And what about me?
This world is filled with hate!
There's nothing left
If you enslave me, you'll never rescue yourself

Well jealousy, as I recall
Has always been man's hardest fall
To conquer fear, well that's quite a quest
Until we do never rest
A child was born yesterday
Nothing but an innocent babe
Someone sowed a bitter seed
How could it grow but a bitter weed?
Society, how can you teach
If you don't practice what you preach?

If all men were truly brothers
Why then, can't we love one another?
Love and peace from ocean to ocean
Somebody please second my emotion!
All men were born to be free, yeah
What about you? What about me?
This world is filled with hate!
There's nothing left
If you enslave me, you'll only hurt yourself

Hey you! Over there!
I want to know why you left
With all your riches and your fancy things
Can you tell me how many friends can you truly say you have?
