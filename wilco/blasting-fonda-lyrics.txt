Blasting Fonda
I watch the clock a lot
To see where I'm at in the plot
It's like a movie
Starring me
It's all so moving to me
And I don't wanna leave
This walkin' dream

It's up to you
To get me home
I won't go it alone

In days of olden
Silence was golden
I dreamed of you
Hair on my pillow
Like a weepin' willow
Cool breeze flows through

There will be no failure
And I won't be the last
Prima donna
Stuck in a trailer
Blasting Fonda on the news

In days of olden
Silence was golden
I dreamed of you
Hair on my pillow
Like a weepin' willow
Cool breeze flows through
