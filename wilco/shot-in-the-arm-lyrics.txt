The ashtray says you were up all night
When you went to bed with your darkest mind
Your pillow wept and covered your eyes
And you finally slept while the sun caught fire

You've changed

We fell in love in the key of C
We walked along down by the sea
You followed me down the neck to D
You fell again into the sea

You've changed
Oh, you've changed

Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Something in my veins bloodier than blood
Something in my veins bloodier than blood
Something in my veins bloodier than blood
Something in my veins bloodier than blood

The ashtray says you were up all night
When you went to bed with your darkest mind

You've changed
Oh, you've changed

What you once were isn't what you want to be any more
What you once were isn't what you want to be any more
What you once were isn't what you want to be any more
What you once were isn't what you want to be any more
What you once were isn't what you want to be any more
