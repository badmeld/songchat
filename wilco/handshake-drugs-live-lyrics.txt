I was chewing gum for something to do
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew
Inside, out of love, what a laugh
I was looking for you

Saxophones started blowing me down
I was buried in sound, taxicabs were driving me around
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown

They were translated poorly, I felt like a clown
I looked like someone I used to know
I felt alright and if I ever was myself
I wasn't that night

Oh, it's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe that's the only, way for me to be
Exactly what you want me to be
Oh, it's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe that's the only way for me to be
Exactly what you want me to be

Oh, it's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe that's the only way for me to be
Exactly what do you want me to be?
