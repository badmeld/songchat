Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
Wherever you go
Wherever you land

Say what this means to me
I'll do what I can
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan

Fundamental problem
All need to face
This is important
But I know you're not listening
Oh, I know you're not listening

If this was still new to me
I wouldn't understand
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan

This is what love is for
To be out of place
Gorgeous and alone
Face to face

With no larger problems
That need to be erased
Nothing more important than to know
Someone's listening
Now I know you'll be listening
