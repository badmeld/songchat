Close your eyes and go to sleep, baby
Take your head off your feet, honey
'Cause you've been working hard
And I know you're tired
I've been trying hard not to think I'm a liar

What's the world got in store?
What's the world got in store for you?
What's the world got in store for you now?

Come on, baby, somehow, I need you
Do I have to show you how, baby?
I'm not trying to knock you out or what's it about
I just know you need your rest
But I can't say what's best for you

You've been working hard
And I know you're tired
I've been trying hard not to feel like a liar

What's the world got in store?
What's the world got in store for you?
What's the world got in store for you now?
What's the world got in store?
What's the world got in store for you?
What's the world got in store for you now?
