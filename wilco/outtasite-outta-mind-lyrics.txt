I know we don't talk much
But you're such a good talker
Well I know we should take a walk
But you're such a fast walker
Well alright

I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Outta mind, outta site

Well okay I know you don't love me
But you'll still be thinking of me
Well alright, I know you probably hate me
That's okay with me, alright

I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Outta mind, outta site
Outta mind, outta site

You don't see me now
You don't want to anyhow

Look out, here I come again
And I'm bringing my friends
Look out, here I come again
I'm bringing my friends, okay alright okay alright

I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Outta mind outta site
Outta mind outta site
Outta mind outta site
