At my window, sad and lonely
Oft times do I think of thee
Sad and lonely and I wonder
Do you ever think of me?

Every day is sad and lonely
And every night is sad and blue
Do you ever think of me, my darling
As you sail that ocean blue?

At my window, sad and lonely
I stand and look across the sea
And I sad and lonely wonder
Do you ever think of me?

Will you find another sweetheart
In some far and distant land?
Sad and lonely, now I wonder
If our boat will ever land?

Ships may ply the stormy ocean
And planes may fly the stormy sky
I'm sad and lonely but remember
Oh I'll love you till I die
