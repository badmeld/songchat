Ha-ah-ah, [?] of time is on
Ah-ah-ah, a kid counting up
Now-ow-ow, he held out his heart
Ah-ah-ah, oh, now you want

More than we have
More than there is
More than he has
More than there is
More than exists

Ah-ah-ah, I still watch [?]
Ah-ah-ah, only 10 episodes
Ah-ah-ah, it's everything I feel
Ah-ah-ah, in a mask of fears

More than I have
More than there is
More than I have
More than I can give
Wants more than I have
More than there is
More than I have
More than there is
Than exists
