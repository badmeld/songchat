
I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight on a bed
Of California stars
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight on a bed
Of California stars

I'd love to feel your hand touching mine
And tell me why I must keep working on
Yes, I'd give my life to lay my head tonight on a bed
Of California stars

I'd like to dream my troubles all away on a bed
Of California stars
Jump up from my star bed and make another day underneath
My California stars

They hang like grapes on vines that shine
And warm the lovers glass like friendly wine
So I'd give this world just to dream, a dream with you on our bed
