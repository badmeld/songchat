When red is black and petals blue
And in my sleepless head our love's been dead a week or two
Sometimes good times are stuck inside of you
And then they're gone. But I don't know why
A lot of things have changed since you said goodbye

There are reasons for you to love me
But I gave you none
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with

Sometimes just time, cars can't escape
When clouds are playing close, not often too far away
Blue has no value, power, or hue
Open skies, relationless
Carelessness is what I miss
And that's how I think of you

Sometimes good times WERE all we HAD to do
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with
