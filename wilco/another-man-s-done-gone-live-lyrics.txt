Sometimes I think I'm gonna lose my mind
It don't look like I ever do
I loved so many people everywhere I went
Some too much, and others not enough

Oh I don't know, I may go
Down or up or anywhere
But I feel like this scribbling might stay

Maybe if I had not seen so much hard feelings
I might not could've felt other people's
So when you think of me, if and when you do
Just say, "Well, another man's done gone
Well, another man's done gone"
