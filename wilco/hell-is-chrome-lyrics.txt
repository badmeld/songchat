When the devil came he was not red
He was chrome, and he said

Come with me you must go
So I went where everything was clean
So precise and towering

I was welcomed with open arms
I received so much help in every way
I felt no fear, I felt no fear

The air was crisp like sunny late winter days
A springtime yawning high in the haze
And I felt like I belonged, come with me

Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me

Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
