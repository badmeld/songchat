Over and over and over again
You say that we're just friends
Forget the implications
Infatuations end
If love's so easy
Why's it hard?
I can't imagine ever being apart
I'd come back to you
It'd be brand new
But I promise we're just friends
Over and over and over again
I try to make amends
For every thing that I've done wrong
My whole world just ends
You make some coffee
Hold me up
Try to talk me outta giving up
I'd come back to you
It'll be brand new

But I promise
We're just friends
