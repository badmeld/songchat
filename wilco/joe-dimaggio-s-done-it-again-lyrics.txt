Joe DiMaggio's done it again
Joe DiMaggio's done it again
Clackin' that bat, gone with the wind
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

Some folks thought Big Joe was done
Some just figured Joe was gone
Steps to the platter with a great big grin
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

I'm gonna tell you just the way I feel
Man can't run without his heel
Watch that raggy pill split the wind
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

All three fielders jumped their best
Trying to climb that high board fence
They all growed whiskers on their chins
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

Up along the clouds where the eagles roam
Joe cracked that ball to whine and moan
His buddies all laugh as they trot on in
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

Grandma's home by the radio
On the television watching Joe
She jerks the beard off of Grandpa's chin
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

The puppy dog barked at the pussycat
How does it look from where you sat?
Looks like a cyclone slidin' in
Joe DiMaggio's done it again
