If it's just your heart talkin', I don't mind
If you wanna call me, darlin,' that's just fine, that's just fine
But if it's your mind that's wanderin', it'll fall in line
When I kiss your cheek, dear, everytime, everytime

We used to have a lot of things in common
But you know now we're just the same
You always had more than I really wanted
Oh honey, help me
Oh honey, help me pick up the change

If it's just your heart talkin', I'll listen every time
Dear, you can talk my ear off, anytime, anytime
But if my mind starts wanderin', won't be gone long
Whenever I hear your heart talkin', it's a song, it's a song

We used to have a lot of things in common
But you know now we're just the same
You always had more than I really wanted
Oh honey, help me
Come on honey, help me pick up
Oh honey, help me pick up the change

Oh honey, help me
Come on honey, help me pick up
Oh honey, help me pick up the change
