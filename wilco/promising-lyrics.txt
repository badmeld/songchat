Cross your fingers behind your back
Squeeze mine until they crack
I must have known you were just promising
Promising, promising

Toothy smile, girly style
In the back yard, all the while
I must have known you were just promising
Promising, promising

I promise you and you promise me
Not to admit defeat
I promise, you promise me

So comforting, wear your ring
Over my head, around my finger
I must have known you were just promising
Promising, promising

I promise you and you promise me
Not to admit defeat
I promise, you promise me
