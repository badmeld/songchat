You and I, we might be strangers
However close we get sometimes, it's like we've never met
But you and I, I think we can take it
All the good with the bad, make something that no one else has

But you and I
You and I

Me and you, what can we do?
When the words we use sometimes are misconstrued
I won't guess what's coming next
I can't ever tell, you're the deepest well I've ever fallen into

Oh, I don't want to know
Oh, I don't want to know
Oh, I don't need to know
Everything about you

Oh, I don't want to know
And you don't need to know
That much about me

You and I, we might be strangers
However close we get sometimes, it's like we've never met
But you and I, I think we can take it
All the good with the bad, make something that no one else has

But you and I
You and I
