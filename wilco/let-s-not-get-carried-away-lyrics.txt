I got a million better things to do
Than to play rock 'n' roll
Honey, if I blow your fuse
Can I please be excused?

Gotta right myself today
I can't right myself for you
We haven't even been introduced
So that'll never do

Though a lot of other people could
Standing here instead of me
Singing their own lines
Through clenching, cracking teeth

Gotta right myself today
Gotta right myself for you
Honey, if I tell you the truth
Can I pleased be excused?

Honey, let's not get carried away

There's a lot of other places to be
A lot of things I would rather be doing
A lot of songs I'd love to sing
But I know that you would just ruin it

Gotta right myself today
I gotta right myself for you
Honey, if I tell you the truth
Can I pleased be excused?

Honey, let's not get carried away

Gotta right myself today
I gotta right myself for you
Honey, if I tell you the truth
Can I pleased be excused?
