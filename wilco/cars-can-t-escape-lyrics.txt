When red is bled
And petals blue
And in my sleepless head
Our love's been dead a week or two

Sometimes, good times
Are stuck inside of you
And then they're gone
But I don't know why

A lot of things have changed
Since we said goodbye
There were reasons for you to love me
But I gave you none

So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with

So time's just time
Cars can't escape
When clouds are gray and close
Not often, too far away

And blue has no value, power, or hue
Or open skies, relationless
Carelessness is what I miss
And that's how I think of you

Sometimes, good times
Were all we had to do
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with

So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with
