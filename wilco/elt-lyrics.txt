I should've been listening
To every word you said
Oh, what did I've been missing
Wishing that you were dead

I didn't mean to be so disturbing
So far from home
Oh, what did I've been learning
By being all alone

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
(Is gonna)
Just tears you apart

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
(Is gonna)
Just tears you apart

When, when we were younger
Sleep while I'm awake
I was trying to keep the door locked
Now I realize that's a mistake

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Is gonna
Tear you apart

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
(Is gonna)
Tear you apart

Every little thing that you do
Seems so much better than I could do
Oh, I should've been listening
To every word you said

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
(Is gonna)
Tear you apart

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
(Is gonna)
Tear you apart
(It's gonna)

Every little thing
(It's gonna)
Every little thing
(It's gonna)
Every little thing
(Is gonna)
Tear you apart

Every little thing
(It's gonna)
Every little thing
(It's gonna)
Every little thing
(Is gonna)
Tear you apart

(It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna)
Tear you apart
(It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna)
Tear you apart
