[Verse 1]
Have you seen any mention?
It’s been quiet in detention all week
Is that so?
I saw the winter party person candidate, give a sermon
Shook his fists like this
Is that so?
And everyone sat as blank as a cake
And in love like a stupid lump of clay
Is that so?
I know a good Armageddon might have made my day, that day
Is that so?

[Chorus]
We aren’t the world
We aren’t the children
But you are my safety girl
[Verse 2]
And you know we could go and spend ourselves like money
Let’s pretend we’re hundred dollar bills
Like so
And complain every day there’s a spider in my soup
Tired of my opinion, like everybody else
Is that so?

[Chorus]
We aren’t the world
We aren’t the children
But you’re my safety girl

[Post-Chorus]
Like so
Oh, is that so?

[Chorus]
We aren’t the world
We aren’t the children
But you’re my safety girl
