The way things go you get so low
Struggle to find your skin
Hey ho, look out below
Your prayers will never be answered again

Phones still ring and singers sing
Speakers are speaking in code
What now well anyhow
Our prayers will never be answered again

You know it's all beginning
(It's all beginning)
To feel like it's ending
(Feels like it's ending)
No loves as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

The way things get you get so high
Funny how we make new friends
Oh hey ho I gotta go
My prayers will never be answered again

You know it's all beginning
(It's all beginning)
To feel like it's ending
(Feels like it's ending)
No loves as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

Speakers speaking
Speakers speaking
Speaking in code
Speakers speaking
Speakers speaking
Speaking in code

You know it's all beginning
(It's all beginning)
To feel like pretending
(To feel like pretending)
No loves as random
As my love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
