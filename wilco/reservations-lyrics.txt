How can I convince you, it's me I don't like?
An' not be so indifferent to the look in your eyes
When I've always been distant
An' I've always told lies for love

I'm bound by these choices, so hard to make
I'm bound by the feelin', so easy to fake
None of this is real enough to take me from you

Oh, I've got reservations
About so many things
But not about you

I know this isn't what you were wantin' me to say
How could I get closer and be further away?
From the truth proves it's beautiful to lie

An' I've got reservations
'Bout so many things
But not about you

I've reservations
'Bout so many things
But not about you

Not about you
Not about you
Not about you
Not about you
