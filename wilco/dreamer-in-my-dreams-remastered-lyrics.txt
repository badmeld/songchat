Well there's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
With light shining off the snow

Well there's a singer in my heart
Burning up my charts
With songs about things we all know

Well there's a blister on his brain
That's driving him insane
'Cause all good things they gotta go

Well there's a child on the way
It could be any day
But how this life will change him
That, we don't know, woah

Well there's a child on the way
Gonna look just like him
One day, he's gonna say
"Ain't you my dad?"

Then he's gonna look down and smile
And after a while, he'll say,
"That's for sure, 'cause you got my eyes."

Well there's a dreamer in my dreams
He's hanging from the beams
With a light shining off the snow

And there's a blister on his brain
It's driving him insane
And all good things have to go
Alright

There's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
With a light shining off the lake

Well I know I've made mistakes
I'm passing them on
But I hope he gets up before dawn
Alright

(Yeah, that's it)

There's a dreamer in my dreams
Climbing up the back
Of a car they used to call a Cadillac

It's got a brand new set of keys
It's got a new look, it's got a new look
And he's gonna, he's gonna take it all the way

(I'm leaving)

There's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
All jacked up in my garage

He's hanging from a belt
He don't know what he's done
Just don't forget to say goodbye when he's gone

(That's it!)
