Don't cry for me now sisters and brothers
Dynamite my soul
Watch it rise above the trees and the gutters
Step not where it falls

My heart has been long forgotten
My bones have been pushed through the door
And if tomorrow I woke up with it all
I'd still need more

I brought myself to come to you
It wasn't that hard
90 miles exactly I traveled
To your backyard

Don't cry for me sisters and brothers
Just dynamite my soul
And watch it rise above the trees and the gutters
Step not where it falls

(Think that was good enough)
