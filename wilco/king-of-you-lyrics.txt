Wave after wave
Wishes unspoken
Talks like a blowtorch
Palms out in full

Who said it's easy
Language is losing
My swallowed esteem and
Claim to be stupid

Nails on the threshold
Move free, don't make me the king of you

Past is a point
Behind the horizon
[?] of the flame
Burning the garden

Smiling on the threshold
Move free, don't make me the king of you
Well, I sold you 'fore you frighten
Climbing, don't make me the king of you

Wave after wishes
My boon companion
Talks to the crosswords
Who'll cheer the champions
