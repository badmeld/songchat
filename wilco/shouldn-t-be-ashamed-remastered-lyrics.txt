To live without a savior, answer to his name
Shouldn't be afraid, shouldn't be ashamed
Like a kid behind the counter, remembering your name
Shouldn't be afraid, shouldn't be ashamed

If it's not like I told ya
Then it's still your call
You should live how you want
Stay with me, we should stay apart
Just shouldn't ever have to be this hard

Like a man on the sidewalk, remembering your face
Shouldn't look away, shouldn't be afraid
He remembers when they still wore gaiters, World War One
Shouldn't be afraid, shouldn't be ashamed

As if it's not like I told you
Then it's still your call
You should live how you want
Stay with me, we should stay apart
Just shouldn't ever have to be this hard
