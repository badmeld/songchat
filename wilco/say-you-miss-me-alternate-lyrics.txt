I've been sleeping alone
Out on my own
I'm sure it seems like I'm taking my time to get back to you
You've been doing your part, working real hard
I'm not lying, sure it seems like I'm trying to get back at you

Do you miss me too?
Baby say I'll miss you
Just say you miss me too
Do you miss me too?
Baby say I'll miss you
Just say you miss me too

I've been losing my mind, wasting my time
I'm not crazy, sure it seems like I'm lazin' up to get back to you
You've been taking it hard, I know it's hard
I'm not lying, sure it seems like I'm trying to get back at you

Do you miss me too?
Baby, say I'll miss you
Just say you miss me too
Do you miss me too?
Baby, say I'll miss you
Just say you miss me too

Well I've been mixed up
Since the breakup
Why I need you to say
Well everything's okay

Baby, say I'll miss you
Just say you miss me too
Baby, say I'll miss you
Just say you miss me too
