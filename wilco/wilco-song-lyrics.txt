Are you under the impression
This isn't your life?
Do you dabble in depression?

Is someone twisting a knife in your back?
Are you being attacked?
Oh, this is a fact
That you need to know
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Wilco, Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby

Are times getting tough?
Are the roads you travel rough?
Have you had enough of the old?
Tired of being exposed to the cold?

Stare at your stereo
Put on your headphones
Before you explode
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Wilco, Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby

There's so many wars that just can't be won
Oh, oh, oh
Even before the battle's begun
Oh, oh, oh

This isn't all of our arms open wide
A sonic shoulder for you to cry
Ah, ah, ah, oh

Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby

Is someone twisting a knife in your back?
Are you being attacked?
Oh, this is a fact
That you need to know
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Wilco, Wilco, Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby
