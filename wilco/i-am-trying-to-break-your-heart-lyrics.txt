I am an American aquarium drinker
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hidin' out in the big city blinkin'
What was I thinkin' when I let go of you?

Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightnin'
Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers
This is not a joke so please stop smilin'
What was I thinkin' when I said it didn't hurt?

I want to glide through those brown eyes dreamin'
Take it from the inside, baby hold on tight
You were so right when you said, "I've been drinkin'"
What was I thinkin' when we said good night?

I wanna hold you in the Bible-black predawn
You're quite a quiet domino, bury me now
Take off your band-aid 'cause I don't believe in touchdowns
What was I thinkin' when we said hello?

I'd always thought that if I held you tightly
You'd always love me like you did back then
Then I fell asleep in the city kept blinkin'
What was I thinkin' when I let you back in?

I am trying to break your heart
I am trying to break your heart
But still I'd be lyin' if I said, it wasn't easy
I am trying to break your heart

Disposable dixie-cup drinkin'
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hidin' out in the big city blinkin'
What was I thinkin' when I let go of you?

Loves you
I'm the man who loves you
