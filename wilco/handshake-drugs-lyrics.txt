I was chewin' gum for somethin' to do
The blinds were bein' pulled down on the dew
Inside, out of love, what a laugh
I was lookin' for you

Saxophones started blowin' me down
I was buried in sound
Taxicabs were drivin' me around

To the handshake drugs, I bought downtown
To the handshake drugs, I bought downtown

They were translated poorly, I felt like a clown
I looked like someone, I used to know
I felt alright and if I ever was myself
I wasn't that night

Oh it's okay for you to say
"What you want from me?
I believe that's the only way for me to be
Exactly what you want me to be"

Oh it's okay for you to say

I believe that's the only way for me to be
Exactly what you want me to be?
