You've seen it all
Turns friends into strangers
But they forget to call
And after all you felt like hanging
But now you're alone
It didn't wanna be
Watching the TV
Too little, too soon
And there's a sun
In a manor key
And how could he be
So too cloudless tune

I know there's rain
Falling somewhere over a flowing
Into distrust
We hold without ever knowing

But you
You might be the sun
Hovering no one
Pulls me closer
Watch it arise
And I
I could be the one
Who stares too long

But if you could see yourself
Just once
The way that you are
And I believe
That the sun is just a star
