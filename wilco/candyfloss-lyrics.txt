I'm the boy that looks excited
I'm the boy that's gonna fall apart
Candyfloss, I lie to myself
I'm the boy that eats his heart out

I know I should be more careful
I know I should watch where I've been
Candyfloss and she's a safecracker
She kissed me first, then broke in

We slip and slide on the stay-together landmine
I make my mind up to never be myself
And every time I fake around
I live my life for someone else

She's in the kitchen with bitter diamond drunks
(She's in the way)
I'm on the sofa hoping she leaves that punk 'cause
  (I'm in the way)

I'm the boy with the poetry power
I'm the boy, smells like flowers
Every time I dick around
I live my life like I wasn't invited

She's in the way
I'm in the way

I'm the boy that looks excited
I'm the boy that's gonna fall apart
Candyfloss, she kissed me first
And I'm the boy, don't get me started

I know I should be more careful
I know I should watch where I've been
Candyfloss, she's a safecracker
She kissed me first, then broke in
