One, two, three, four

Well I know, I haven't paid my dues
And I've poured out all my love in vain
But if you haven't heard the news
But I'm losing interest in playing the blues

I'm still shaking but I can dust my broom
And my arms goes snow
Well I stroll
In this one I thought there was nothing left to loose
But I'm losing interest in playing the blues

My money has gone
My cock is too
My baby has gone so are you
And I'm losing interest in playing the blues

We're the sunshines
Wherever my children are
And my blood runs deep
In their hearts

And if they should ever happen to find you
Please don't let them losing interest in playing the blues
Please don't let them losing interest in playing the blues
