Oh there's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
With light shining off the snow
Well there's a singer in my heart
Burning up my charts
With songs about things we all know

Well there's a blister on his brain
That's driving him insane
Cause all good things they gotta go

Well there's a child on the way
It could be any day
But how this life will change him
That we don't know

Well there's a child on the way
Gonna look just like him
One day, he's gonna say
Ain't you my dad?

Then he's gonna look down and smile
And after a while, he'll say,
That's for sure, cause you got my eyes

Well there's a dreamer in my dreams
He's hanging from the beams
With a light shining off the snow

Well there's a singer in my heart
Burning up my charts
With songs about things we all know

There's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
With a light shining off the snow

Well there's a child on the way
It's gonna be any day
But he knows
He knows I've made mistakes
