I've been sleepin' alone, out on my own
I'm sure it seems like I'm takin' my time to get back to you
You been doin' your part, working real hard, I'm not lying
Sure it seems like I'm trying to get back at you

Do you miss me too? Baby say "I'll miss you"
Just say "You'll miss me too"
Do you miss me too? Baby say "I'll miss you"
Just say "You'll miss me too"

I've been losing my mind, wastin' my time, I'm not crazy
Sure it seems like I'm lazy, lets get back to you
You been takin' it hard, I know it's hard, I'm not lyin'
Sure it seems like I'm tryin' to get back at you

Do you miss me too? Baby say "I'll miss you"
Just say "You'll miss me too"
Do you miss me too? Baby say "I'll miss you"
Just say "You'll miss me too"

Well I been mixed up
Since the break up
Well all I need you to say
Well everything's okay

Baby say "I'll miss you"
Just say "You'll miss me too"
Baby say "I'll miss you"
Just say "You'll miss me too"
