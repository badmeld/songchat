Theres a whisper
I would like to breathe into your ear
But I'm too scared
To get that close to you right now

There are dreams
We might have shared and I still care
And I still love you
But you know how I've been untrue

In the beginning
We closed our eyes
Whenever we kissed
We were surprised to find so much inside
