My cold marigolds attack
my back, a bed of roses
I'm gonna bring em all back
With hypnosis ha!

and I know that I won't be
the easiest to set free
and I know I won't be the last
Cold captain tied to the mast

I recall on the telephone
I recall it when we get married
I'll still love you to death
and I won't ever forget how!

And I know that I won't be
Easiest to set free
And I know that I won't be the last
Cold Captain tied to the mast

Well I'm on the other side
Well I'm satisfied
Well I'm a spirit dove
I'm looking for your love

I'm super as a matter of fact
punch in the nose don't overreact
I'll still love you to death
and I won't ever forget how

And I know that I won't be
The easiest to set free
and I know that I won't be the last
Cold captain tied to the mast
and I know that I won't be the one
To securely know when it's wrong
But I hope I know when it's past
And I hope I'll know when to show you my

Whole Love

Whole - I won't ever forget how
