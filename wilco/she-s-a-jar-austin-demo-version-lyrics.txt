she's a jar
with a heavy lid
my pop quiz kid
a sleepy kisser
a pretty war
with feelings hid
she begs me not to miss her
She says forever to light a fuse
We could use
a hand full of wheel
and a day off
and a brusied robe
However,
you might feel tonight is real
When I forget how to talk I say
"Won't you please,
bring that flash to shine"
turn my eyes red
as they close
when they click
and my face gets sick
stuck, like a question, unposed.
Just climb aboard
the tracks of the train's arm
in my fragile family tree
And watch me float
inches above
the people underneath me
Please, beware
the quiet front jar
I warned you before there were water skies
I warned you not to drive
now dry your eyes, you poor devil
Are there really ones like these?
The ones I dreamed
float like leaves
and freeze to spread
skeleton wings
I passed through before I knew you
I believe
It's because
Daddy's payday
is not enough.
Just climb aboard
the tracks of the train's arm
In my fragile family tree
Watch me floating inches above
the people underneath.
She's a jar
with a heavy lid
my pop quizzer kisser, a pretty war
with feelings hid,
you know she begs me
not to hit her.
