Capitol city, skyline photo
Skyscrapers shine, the sun's so
Low in the sky
Secretaries at the hot dog vendors
Cabs honk at the bicycle messengers
Rolling by
I can't call with a subway token
Anyway, the phones are all broken
I wish you were here,
better yet I wish I was there with you

You wouldn't like it here
You should stay right there
Breath'in that country air
You wouldn't like it here 

Capitol towers radiate a steam vent
Scream along with the clarinets and
Arguments echo down the hall

I can't sleep, I can't wake up
Shakin' up, maybe we should break up
I wish you were here, better yet
I wish I was there with you

You wouldn't like it here
You should stay right there
Breathin' that country air
You wouldn't like it here ...

Capitol city, skyline photo
Picture postcard sign the moon's so
I can't smile when my heart's still broken
Far away, in love and unspoken
I wish you were here
Or I was there with you
