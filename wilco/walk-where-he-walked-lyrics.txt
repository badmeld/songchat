Walk Where He Walked
There's a man on TV claims he killed 23
Burnt their bodies and collected their teeth
There's another man at home with his wife and family tree
Who agreed this would make a good movie?
And I'm sittin' here, wonderin' what this is all doin' to me

He sold the book rights, and he was set for life
A woman on a talk show wants to be his wife
Another man decides to purchase his knife
A court decides he's got the right
And I'm sittin' here, wonderin' how he can ever sleep at night

I don't want to walk where he walked
I don't want to talk to who he stalked
I don't want to walk where he walked

First it was a book, and then it was a movie
They cut it all up and they put it on the TV
The starring role was played by Christopher Reeves
He was fine, he was something to see
And I'm sitting here, wondering what this is all doing to me

I don't want to walk where he walked
I don't want to talk to who he stalked
I don't want to walk where he walked
Oh Lord I didn't catch how he got caught
