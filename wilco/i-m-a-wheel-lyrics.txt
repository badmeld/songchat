Oh, hold on
You risk exciting me
Once in Germany someone said, "Nein"
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9

Oh, hold back
Oh, don't invite me
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
Once in Germany someone said, "Nein"

I'm a wheel
I will, turn on you

Oh, I invented a sister
Populated with knives, uh
Uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh
Uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh

I'm a wheel
I will, turn on you

Um, I'm a wheel, I will
I'm a wheel, I will
I'm a wheel, I will
Turn on you

I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you
Turn on, turn on you, turn on you
I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you
Turn on, turn on you, turn on you

I'm gonna turn on you
Turn on you, turn on you
