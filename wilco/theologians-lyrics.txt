Theologians, they don't know nothing
About my soul, about my soul
I'm an ocean, an abyss in motion
Slow motion, slow motion

Inlitterati lumen fidei
God is with us everyday
That illiterate light
Is with us every night

Theologians, oh, they don't know nothing
About my soul, oh, they don't know
They thin my heart with little things and my life with change
Oh, in so many ways I find more missing every day

(Theologians)

I'm going away where you will look for me
Where I'm going you cannot come
No one is ever gonna take my life from me
I lay it down, a ghost is born
A ghost is born, a ghost is born

I'm an ocean, I'm all emotion
I'm a cheery ghost, cheery ghost
Hey, I'm a cheery ghost, a cheery ghost
