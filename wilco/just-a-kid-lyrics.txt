Maybe I'm just a kid
Maybe I just don't fit in
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to go now

I don't wanna go to school
But I don't get to make the rules
Too early, too early, too early, too early in the morning

Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to do something they don't want to do
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to be something, oh, why is that true?

Maybe I'm not so big
Maybe I just don't fit in
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready for more now

And I don't wanna go to bed
There's so much going on in my head
Not tired, not tired, not tired, not tired right now

Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to do something they don't want to do
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to be something, oh, why is that true?

Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to be something, let's have some fun

Na na na

Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody

Everybody, everyone, somebody, anyone
Has to grow up, let's have some fun
