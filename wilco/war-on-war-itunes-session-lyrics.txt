you have to learn how to die

Just watching the miles flying by
just watching the miles flying by
you are not my typewriter
but you could be my demon
moving forward through the flaming doors

you have to learn how to die
if you want to want to be alive, okay?

You have to lose
you have to lose
you have to learn how to die
if you want to want to be alive
You have to die
you have to die
you have to learn how to die
if you want to want to be alive, okay?
