I need a camera, to my eye
To my eye, remindin'
Which lies that I've
Been hiding, which echoes belong

I've counted it out
Days to see how far
I've driven in the dark
Echoes in my heart

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost
On the sidewalk
And, no, it's not ok

I smashed a camera
I wanna know why
To my eye, decidin'
Which lies that I've been hiding
Which echoes belong

I'm counting on
A heart I know by heart
To walk me through this war
Where memories distort

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost
On the sidewalk
And, no, it's not ok

I've counted it out
No one knows how far
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
I've driven in the dark
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
Echoes in my heart
(Tell 'em I'm lost)

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost
Yea, I'm lost
And, no, it's not ok
No it's not ok, no it's not ok
