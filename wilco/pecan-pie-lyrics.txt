Pecan Pie
As I, walk along and stumble,
Trains rumble in my head.
As I breathe along and grumble,
I think about you instead.

And a piece of the pecan pie
And you, that's all I want.
Just a piece of pecan pie.
And all I want is you.

Sometimes I get so hungry
I think about pie all day.
Just a little whipped cream
And honey, I'm on my way.

And a piece of the pecan pie
And you, that's all I want.
Just a piece of pecan pie.
And all I want is you.

Now don't you call me Key Lime
You're the apple of my eye
And don't you know I'll be fine
Whenever you're by my side.

And a piece of the pecan pie
And you, that's all I want.
Just a piece of pecan pie.
And all I want is you.
