I was on my way home from high school
Stuck at the crossing I dug in for a duel
But at the last moment I buried the brakes
My life split in two directions, into two separate fates

I got on the last flight to Amsterdam
But couldn't hit the runway so we took off again
Oh, there's no need to worry, the captain cut in
The winds are less angry over in Berlin

You know it's true the other shoe
It waits for you, what can you do?
Remember to show gratitude
The darkest night is nothing new

Sonny's got a problem, all the mini mart clerks know
She knows nothing of Eminem's suburban gangster flow
Oh, maybe it's random how each moment unfolds
It didn't feel like the wrong time or place until they cut off her clothes

A sunny feeling is taken away
A sunny feeling is taken away
A sunny feeling is taken away
A sunny feeling is taken away

I'm on my way home from my high school
I'm always contemplating why the kids are still cruel
Oh, the kids are still cruel

A sunny feeling is taken away
A sunny feeling is taken away
A sunny feeling is taken away
Some of the feeling is taken away
