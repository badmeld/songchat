You're trying my patience
Try pink carnations
Red roses, yellow daffodils
Don't forget the flowers
Someday, I know you will

Displays of affection
And all good intentions
Why don't you just send me the bill
Don't forget the flowers
Someday, I know you will

Well, you've been taking me
Way to seriously, ooh
I can't ever explain why
I don't feel your pain, ooh

I left you behind
I know it's been a long time
But I'm not over you
Don't forget the flowers
Someday, I hope I do

You're trying my patience
Try pink carnations
Red roses and yellow daffodils
Don't forget the flowers
Someday, I know I will
Don't forget the flowers
Someday, I know I will
