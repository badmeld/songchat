Don't You Honey Me
Don't you honey me honey bee
A good time I'll set you free
Don't be too nice too nice to me
I've been stung and I've grown mean

Honestly I know what you want
And I can't satisfy you
Honestly it hurts me too
And I don't want to make you blue
Make you blue
I don't wanna make you blue

Don't sit next to me in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Who's that bouncing on your knee
Could it be my baby bumble bee
Who's that bouncing on your knee
Give me back my baby bumble bee
Honestly I know what you need
And I just wanna be true
I love you too
And I don't wanna make you blue
Make you blue
I don't wanna make you blue
