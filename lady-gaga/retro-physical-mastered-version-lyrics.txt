People grab the hardes to get a whole of the world
So that everybody here can stop smoking.

Uh-huh.

Let's get into trouble
Lots of trouble
Rock star
You know how to rock hard (hard).

Hello midnight lover (lover)
Hold that lady tighter
Shoot that bullet through her
(alright)

My heart beats just like a cherry soda
In a summer.
Go, go, go
Don't be difficult
About it.
Get off it.

Off the walls
(get your ass)
Off the walls
(do that girl)
Don't stop now
Retro physical.

Off the walls
(get your ass)
Off the walls
(move that boy)
So sexual
Retro Physical
