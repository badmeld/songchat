There's no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah baby
Tonight, yeah baby
There's no reason you shouldn't take me home tonight (tonight)

I need a man who thinks it right when it's so wrong,
Tonight yeah baby,
Tonight yeah baby,
Right on the limits where we know we both belong tonight (tonight)

It's time to feel the rush,
To push the dangerous
I'm gonna run back to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall in love

I'm on The Edge of Glory,
and I'm hanging on a moment of truth,
I'm on The Edge of Glory,
and I'm hanging on a moment with you,
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
I'm on The Edge of Glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

Another shot, before we kiss the other side,
Tonight, yeah baby
Tonight, yeah baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight
Alright, alright
Pull out your shade 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah baby
Tonight, yeah baby
It doesn't hurt everybody know my name tonight
Alright, alright

It's time to feel the rush
To push the dangerous
I'm gonna run back to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall in love

I'm on The Edge of Glory,
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth,
I'm on The Edge of Glory,
And I'm hanging on a moment with you,
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge

I'm on The Edge of Glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge with you

I'm on The Edge of Glory,
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth,
I'm on The Edge of Glory,
And I'm hanging on a moment with you,
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge

I'm on The Edge of Glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
With you
With you
With you
With you

I'm on the edge with you
With you
With you
With you

I'm on the edge with you
With you

I'm on the edge with you
With you
