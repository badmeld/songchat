"Where is it? Where is it, Candy? Candy?"
"He ate it."
"Yes. I don't believe you."
"Look For Yourself... Pop Ate My Heart."
"I see."
"He downed the whole thing... in one efficient gulp...
like a beautiful monster... then took off into the city."
"Oh, Candy"
"And now I just feel... I feel so..."
"Empty?"
" Noo... No..."
"Candy?"
"Free... I feel free"

I NEED MORE... TO FEED MY POP HEART
GIVE ME MORE
I WANT: THE FUTURE, GAGA, FASHION, TECHNOLOGY, DANCE, NEW YORK, MUSIC, POP CULTURE
I WANT... THE FAME
I CAN HEAR YOU
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
REVOLUTION IS COMING
AND I WANT... WHAT WE WANT
YOU DESERVE... THE FUTURE

MY NAME IS LADY GAGA -
AND THIS IS MY HAUS!!!
