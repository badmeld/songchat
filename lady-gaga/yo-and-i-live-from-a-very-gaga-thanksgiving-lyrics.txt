It's been a long time since I came around
It's been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leavin' without you
Yoü taste like whiskey when you kiss me ohh
I'll give anything again to be your baby doll
Yeah this time I'm not leavin' without yoü
Yoü said sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time
And yoü said to me
There's somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin' 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah somethin' about
Baby yoü and I
It's been two years since I let you go,
I couldn't listen to a joke or rock n roll
And muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday yoü sang me a heart of gold
With a guitar hummin' and No clothes
Yeah this time I'm not leavin' without you
Yoü said sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and yoü said to me
There's somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin' 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah somethin' about
Baby yoü and I
Yoü and I
Yoü, yoü and I
Yoü, you and I
Yoü, you and I
Yoü and I
Yoü, yoü and I
Oh yeah, Id rather die
Without yoü and I
Come on, put your drinks up
We got a whole lot of money but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ
There's somethin', somethin' about the chase, six whole years
I'm a New York woman, born to run you down
So have my lipstick all over your face
Somethin, something about just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska I love you
Yoü and I
Yoü, yoü and I
Baby, I'd rather die
Without yoü and I
Yoü and I
Yoü, yoü and I
Nebraska, I'd rather die
Without yoü and I
It's been a long time since I came around
It's been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leavin' without yoü
