I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you've always pined for

Gee, i like to see you looking swell, tony with
Diamond watches, Tiffany's just don't sell, baby
Till the lucky day you know darn well
Oh I can't give you anything but love.

That's the only thing I've plenty of, lady

How you like to see you looking swell? lady
Diamond bracelets, Woolworths doesn't sell, GaGa

Oh I can’t give you anything but love
