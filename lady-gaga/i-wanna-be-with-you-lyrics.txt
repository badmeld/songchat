[Verse 1]
It's off, it's on
The party just begun
Take off, and run
Let's celebrate the fun of being young
I don't wanna grow up (2x)
But when lights, come on
You lift me up and I feel strong

[Chorus]
I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'm writing songs about you
No matter how we get through
I'll keep singing for a living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you [2x]

(Thanks for taking me back)

[Verse 2]
Lights off, lights on
The music has begun
Rely, or run
Get the bad guy's gun
I love the songs that you play
I don't care what they say
Cause I was born this way
I hear you scream
I hit the top of the stage, and my eyes and know exactly who I am, woah

[Chorus]

[Piano Bridge]

[Chorus]

I wanna be with you! [3x]
I wanna be, no matter what breaks me
I wanna be with you
