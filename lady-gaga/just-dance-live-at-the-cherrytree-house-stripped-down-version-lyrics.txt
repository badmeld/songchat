Oh, RedOne
Konvict
Gaga

I've had a little bit too much, much...
All of the people start to rush (start to rush by...)
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink, oh man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone
What's going on-on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?

I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright
Just dance, gonna be okay
Da-da doo-doomm
Just dance, spin that record, babe

Da-da doo-doomm
Just dance, gonna be okay
D-d-d-dance, dance, dance
Just, j-j-just dance...
Wish I could shut my playboy mouth
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? (Inside out right)
Control your poison babe, roses have thorns they say
And we're all getting hosed tonight

What's going on-on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright

Just dance, gonna be okay
Da-da doo-doomm
Just dance, spin that record babe
Da-da doo-doomm
Just dance, gonna be okay
D-d-d-dance, dance, dance
Just j-j-just dance, gonna be okay
Da-da doo-doomm

Just dance, spin that record babe
Da-da doo-doomm

Just dance, gonna be okay
Da-da doo-doom
Just dance, spin that record babe
Da da doo-doom

Just dance, gonna be okay

D-d-d-dance, dance, dance
Just, j-j-just...
Half psychotic, sick hypnotic
Got my blueprint, it's symphonic

Half psychotic, sick hypnotic
Got my blueprint electronic
Half psychotic, sick hypnotic
Got my blueprint, it's symphonic

Half psychotic, sick hypnotic
Got my blueprint electronic
