Whenever I dress cool my parents put up a fight
And if I'm hotshot mom will cut my hair at night
In the morning I'm sure of my identity
I scream Mom and Dad
'Why can't I be who I want to be?'
To be

I just wanna be myself and I want you to love
Me for who I am
I just wanna be myself and I want you to know
I am my hair

I've had enough
This is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough
This is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair

I've had enough
I'm not a freak
I'm just here trying to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough
And this is my prayer, I swear

I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair

I am my hair
I am my hair

Free as my hair
Free as my hair

Sometimes I waltz around, put on red highlights
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
And on Friday rocks in, high school dance
I've got my bangs too hot that I don't stand a chance
A chance

I just wanna be myself and I want you to love
Me for who I am
I just wanna be myself and I want you to know
I am my hair

I've had enough
This is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough
This is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair

I've had enough
I'm not a freak
I'm just here trying to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough
This is my prayer, I swear

I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair

I am my hair
I am my hair

Free as my hair
Free as my hair

I just wanna be free
I just wanna be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
I don't wanna change and I don't wanna be ashamed

I'm the spirit of my Hair
It's all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, I'm my hair
I'm my hair, I'm my hair
I'm my hair, I'm my hair
All the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, I'm my hair
It's all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, I'm my hair
I'm my hair yeaaahhh
All the glory that I bear (I'm my hair)
All the glory that I bear (I'm my hair)
All the glory that I bear (I'm my hair)

I've had enough
This is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough
This is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair

I've had enough
I'm not a freak
I'm just here trying to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough
This is my prayer, I swear

I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair (this is my prayer)

I am my hair
I am my hair

My hair, my hair
