Midnight at the glamor show on Sunday night
Everybody drink a lotta whiskey and wine
We dance like no tomorrow, we're on burlesque time
But everybody's gotta work tomorrow at nine

Touch me, t-t-touch me, baby
But don't mess up my hair
Love me, l-love me crazy
But don't get too attached, this is a brink affair

Vanity
(Pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity
(There is a camera, so many beauty queens)

Vanity
(It's so good to be)
Popular and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else
Vanity, va-va-vanity, vanity

Nothin' wrong with being just a little bit vain
We need a little pretty 'cause this country's insane
So go ahead and label me whatever you like
But nothings quite as sexy as a woman is fine

Touch me, touch me, baby but don't mess up my hair
Love me, love me crazy
But don't get too attached, this is a brink affair

Vanity
(It's so good to be)
Popular and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else
Vanity, va-va-vanity, vanity

Look at me
(Watcha lookin' at?)
Look at me
(Watcha starin' at?)

Look at me
(Watcha lookin' at?)
Look at me
(Watcha starin' at?)

I'm comin' around, I'm sippin' on Andre, it's time [unverified]
I heard that you did the back star [unverified] in the party line
Let's dance
(Quick round)
We're in the vanity house
We'll cover the secret diamonds [unverified]

Touch me, touch me, baby but don't mess up my hair
Love me, love me crazy
But don't get too attached, this is a brink affair
