[unreleased demo]

o-o-oh yeah, babe

last time that we had this talk
boy, you were gettin' ready to leave
I thought that, baby you were done
'cause for a while you could barely look at me
this time I thought that we`d be fine
that I`d forget the things that you said
I tried crossing out your words
but baby, you can not forget the past
oh-o-o-o-oh babe
can not forget the past
oh-o-o-o-oh, babe (still baby)

I’m so unpredictable
you don’t know what to think, so unemotional
wonder if I’m even still in love, you see
I don’t know what to tell you now
it's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable 
just like you used to be, so unemotional
boy, I can't forget the way you were with me
I don’t know what to tell you now
it's always harder the second time around
the second time around

we tried going back to joe’s
that always was our favourite place
long rides baby, by the coast
do you remember where we stayed
last time we where hanging out
you were acting kind of strange
now it’s the second time around
I’m sorry, now it’s me that feels this way
oh-o-o-o-oh babe
(my heart just speaks to me)
it's me that feels this way
oh-o-o-o-oh babe (baby)
I know you are the one that is hurting

I’m so unpredictable
you don’t know what to think, so unemotional
wonder if I’m even still in love, you see
I don’t know what to tell you now
it's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
just like you used to be, so unemotional
boy, I can't forget the way you were with me
I don’t know what to tell you now
it's always harder the second time around

I`m not sure the best way to say this
but I can’t pretend to love you no more, babe
this ferris wheel`s got me crazy
maybe the second time around is not meant for us baby
not meant for us, baby hey-yeah

I’m so unpredictable
you don’t know what to think, so unemotional
wonder if I’m even still in love, you see
I don’t know what to tell you now
it's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
just like you used to be, so unemotional
boy, I can forget the way you were with me
I don’t know what to tell you now
it's always harder the second time around
(2x)
the second time around
