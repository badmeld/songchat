I met a girl in east LA
In floral shorts - as sweet as May
She sang in eights in two-bar chords
We fell in love, but not in court

...
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la-la
...

Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano
...
Mis canciones son de la re-revolución

...
Mi corazón me duele por mi generación

...
If you love me, we can marry, on the west coast,

...
On a Wednesday, en un verano, en agosto
...

I don't speak your, I don't speak your languagono (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I won't speak, won't speak your,

Won't speak your Jesus Christo (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano
...
I will fight for, I have fought for how I love you (La-la-la-la-la-la)

I will die for, I have cried for how I care (La-la-la-la-la-la)
In the mountains, las campanas están sonando
Todos los chicos (Chicas)
Y los chicos (Chicas), están besando

I don't speak your, I don't speak your languagono (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I won't speak your Jesus Christo (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I don't speak your Americano (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I don't speak your, I won't speak your Jesus Christo (La-la-la-la-la-la)

Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano
Ahhhhh America Americano
...
Don't you try to catch me,
Don't you try to catch me
No! No! No! No!
I'm living on the edge of,
Living on the edge of the law, law, law, law
Don't you try to catch me,
Don't you try to get me,
No! No! No! No!
Don't you try to catch me,
Living on the edge of the law, law, law
