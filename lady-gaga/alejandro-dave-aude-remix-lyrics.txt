She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

You know that I love you, boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

She's not broken, she's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like a dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, got cool the bad

You know that I love you, boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Don't call my name

Don't bother me, don't bother me, Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name, bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name, bye, Fernando

Don't bother me, don't bother me, Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name, bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, Fernando

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Don't call my name
Don't call my name

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name…

Alejandro, Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
