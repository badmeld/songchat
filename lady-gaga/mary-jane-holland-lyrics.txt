Lady of the 'Dam won't be a slave to the blonde
Or the culture of the popular (she won't, she won't)
Sing at you, I'll fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight (I will, I will)

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than my darkest sin
Russian hookers and cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me, Mary Jane, in Holland tonight

Mary Jane Holland!
Woo-hoo (puff in)
Mary (puff out) Jane Holland!
Woo-hoo

I don't like to boast, but our truffles are the most
Mad magical in Amsterdam (she won't, she won't)
So if you have fear, Apollo, sit on my lyre, and
Play him like a piano man (I will, I will)

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than my darkest sin
Russian hookers and cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me, Mary Jane, in Holland tonight

Mary Jane Holland!
Woo-hoo (puff in)
Mary (puff out) Jane Holland!
Woo-hoo

I know that mom and dad think I'm a mess
But it's alright because I am rich as piss
When I ignite the flame, and put you in my mouth
The grass eats up my insides, and my brunette starts to sprout

Introducing, ladies and gentlemen
Mary Jane Holland!

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me, Mary Jane, in Holland tonight

Mary Jane Holland!
Woo-hoo (puff in)
Mary (puff out) Jane Holland!
Woo-hoo

Mary Jane Holland!
Woo-hoo
Mary Jane Holland!
Woo-hoo
