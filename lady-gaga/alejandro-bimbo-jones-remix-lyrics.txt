Alejandro (Alejandro)

At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Alejandro (Alejandro)

I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Al-Al…

She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

You know that I love you, boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

She's not broken, she's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like a dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, got cool the bad

You know that I love you, boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Don't call my name (don't call my name)
Don't call my name
Alejandro (Alejandro)
Call on your name

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
