Bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody
Love is just a history that they may prove And when you're gone
I'll tell them my religion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, dance together
Forgive him before he's dead
Because I won't cry for you I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you See, when you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary (Love)

We are not Just art for Michaelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris cold Je ne veux pas mourir toute seule
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, dance together
Forgive him before he's dead
Because I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
Because I won't cry for you See, when you're gone
I'll still be Bloody Mary (Love)
Gaga, gaga Gaga, gaga Gaga, gaga Gaga, gaga
Dum dum, da di da
Dum dum, da di da da da da di da
Dum dum, da di da
Dum dum, da di da
Dum dum, da di da da da da di da
Dum dum, da di da

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you, do, do, do
I won't cry for you
See, when you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No, leibe nacht geht
