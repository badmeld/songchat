I'm gonna marry the night.
I won't give up on my life.
I'm a warrior queen.
Live passionately tonight.

I'm gonna marry the dark.
Gonna make love to the stark.
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness.
I am a winner.

I'm gonna marry the night.
I'm gonna marry the night.
Gonna marry the night.

I'm gonna marry the night.
I'm not gonna cry anymore.
I'm gonna marry the night.
Leave nothin' on these streets to explore.

Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night.
Oh
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night.

I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the street that I love
In my fishnet gloves
I'm a sinner.

Then I'll go down to the bar.
But I won't cry anymore.
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice
I'm a loser.

I'm gonna marry the night.
I'm gonna marry the night.

I'm gonna marry the night.
I'm not gonna cry anymore.
I'm gonna marry the night.
Leave nothin' on these streets to explore.

Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night.
Oh
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night.

Nothing's too cool
To take me from you.

New York is not just a tan that you'll never loose.
Love is the new
Denim or black
Skeleton guns
Are wedding bells in the attic.
Get Ginger ready.
Climb to El Camino front.
Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels
Cuz that's where we make love.

Come on and run.
Turn the car on and run.

I'm gonna marry the night.
We're gonna burn a hole in the road.
I'm gonna marry the night.
Leave nothin' on these streets to explode.

Ma-ma-ma-marry (marry)
Ma-ma-ma-marry (marry)
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night. (the night)
Oh
Ma-ma-ma-marry (marry)
Ma-ma-ma-marry (marry)
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night. (the night)
Oh
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night.

I'm gonna marry (marry)
Marry (marry)
I'm gonna marry (marry)
Marry (marry)
Come on
Come on
The night
The night
The night
The night
The night
The night
The night
The night
The night
