What if I were to leave you,
But then, you fell back in love with me?

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar,
I carry pictures of your,
Neil Young guitar, guitar.

No, I just can't seem to forget you,
No I can't for just as long as I left you,
Your my baby, you never made it through to you.

If I were the last girl,
And you were the last boy,
Left here on this planet,
And there was an earthquake,
Maybe then you'd love,
Maybe then you'd love me,
If there was an earthquake.
Last girl,
And you were the last boy,
Left here on this planet,

How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar,
I carry pictures of your,
