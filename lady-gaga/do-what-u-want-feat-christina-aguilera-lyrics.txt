Who-o-o-oh
...
E-eh, e-eh
...
Who-o-o-oh

Oh, oh
...
Oh
...
I
Feel good
I walk along

...

But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I
I stand up
...
And then I'm OK

But then you break that Shit
That makes me want to scream

...
So Do What U Want
What U Want with my body
Do What U Want
Don't stop, let's party

Do What U Want
What U Want With my body
Do What U Want

What U Want with my body
Write What U Want
Say What U Want 'bout me
If you're wondering

Know that I'm not sorry
Do What U Want
What U Want with my body
What U Want with my body
You can't have my heart

And you won't use my mind but

Do What U Want with my body
Do What U Want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do What U Want with my body
Do What U Want with my body

My

Bones hurts
From all the shows
(Hum)
But I don't feel the pain cause I'm a pro
I
Sink in and then I'm okay

Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage

(E-e-e-e-eh)

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do What U Want with my body
Do What U Want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause

Let me go
