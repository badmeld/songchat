[** Lady Gaga medley lyrics from a 2005 recoding:]


[Captivated]
One look and I'm done
One glance from your eyes
And I'm captivated
The taste of your skin
The warmth of your hungry lips has me so taken and I love the way you
Make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you I am so sedated
I'm captivated by you
You're just like the wind because
Everything moves when you are around it
The sun is just the sound of your voice in the morning
World up and I love the way you
Make me dance from miles away
When I am with you I am never jaded, or captivated
I never stopped believing in this crazy love we live in
Sugar hold me close and make me sweeter I need you I love you
So please show me that smile
Make me laugh for just a little while
And dream one breath I want to fill the emptiness
I love the way you can make
Me dance from miles away
It's been so long, I waited and I am captivated

[Electric Kiss]
We are a generation twisted by a myth,
Confused and ludicrous, holding on to love. 
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst. 
Alive with all the lips we've kissed and losing all control. 
We're gonna start a resistance, 
We want independence. 
We're gonna give the world some of this: 

Electric Kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips. 
One voice forever, we'll live together. 
Peace, Love, Solitude and Happiness: 
Electric Kiss.  

Fame is our felony, we're so in love with it. 
Some superstars and masochists who don't know where to go. 
But the poets and the fighters of our time 
Put down their weapons and their arms and know what they must do. 
They're gonna start a resistance, 
They want independence. 
They're gonna give the world some of this: 

Electric Kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever, We'll live together
Peace, Love, Solitude, and Happiness

Electric Kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever, We'll live together
Peace, Love, Solitude, and Happiness
Electric Kiss
