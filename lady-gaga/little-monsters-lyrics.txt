When they're young
All Little Monsters learn
That they are scary.

Ugly, stupid
Shunned by cupid
Overweight, and hairy.

But every Monster needs to find
That secret deep inside
That transforms Dr. Jekyll into sexy Mr. Hyde!

All my Monsters are beautiful!

Discostoodiful
Squarerootiful
Oldcootiful.

Monsters don't need implants
Or a bitchin' Monster car.
Monsters only need to love
The Monsters that they are.
Oh yeah!
Gaga, Dada, Jawa
Peace!
