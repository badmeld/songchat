We are the crowd, we're coming out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you
It's so magical, we'd be so fantastical

Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means but this photo of us
It don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that baby, I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be your papa-paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

I'll be your girl, backstage at show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar
In between the sets, eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt, yellow dance and return
My lashes are dry, purple teardrops I cry
It don't have a price, loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that baby, I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be your papa-paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Real good, we're dancing in the studio
Stop, stopped that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic but we still have fun

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be your papa-paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
