This is beat is so funny*
We made it with their money
Haha hahahahaha, haha ha ha

(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)

Yeah, you so fancy

See that girl, watch her go
Red high heels and pretty toes
Silly puddy, underoos
Lady's got a killer groove
And you've got a lot to lose

All the famous boys and girls
Stand around and pose
Everybody knows her
Go boom boom boom
We all take off our clothes
Fancy clothes
Take off your fancy clothes

Oh baby don't be shy
Fashion's got a lazy eye
Everybody let's take off our fancy pants tonight

(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy) {2x}

Grab those tights
And lacy bottoms
Don't leave home without 'em
Let's take off our fancy pants tonight

(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy) {2x}

This is beat is so funny
We made it with their money
Haha hahahahaha, haha ha ha

See that boy, watch him go
Blue jeans with an ass like whoa
Silly, funny, sound go rude
Monkey's got a killer groove
Girl's got a lot to lose

All the famous boys and girls
Putting up their nose
Everybody knows her
Now boom boom boom
We all take off our clothes
Fancy clothes
Take off your fancy clothes

Yeah baby, don't be shy
Fashion's got a lazy eye
Everybody let's take off our fancy pants tonight

(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy) {2x}

See those tights
And lacy bottoms
Don't leave home without 'em
Let's take off our fancy pants tonight
