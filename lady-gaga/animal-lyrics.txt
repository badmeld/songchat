You have got a wild side
You're an animal tonight
I see that you are my type
Wild like a tiger, hunting the prey we'll keep
The neighbors up all night
Hot in the jungle
Exotic apparel

I can see the way that you're lookin at me
Like you're hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you love the way your watching me(watch-i-ing me)

Baby I'mma keep you up all night gonna tie you up incase you bite
Animal animal
My animal animal
Baby imma lock you in my cage and I wont stop until you behave
Animal animal
My animal animal
Baby I'mma gonna keep you up all night
Like an animal animal
My animal animal
I'm gonna tie you up incase you bite
You're an animal animal
My animal animal

I don't need to blame you
I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal animal
A-a-animal animal
I don't need to blame you
I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal animal
A-a-animal animal

Oh
You're a hunter, I feel your way
I'll do what ever you say
Hold me down and take control
Messing my hair all, crazy sexual
Do it like an animal
Hot in the jungle
Exotic apparel

I can see the way that you're lookin at me
Like your hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you love the way your watching me(watch-i-ing me)

Baby imma lock you in my cage and I wont stop until you behave
