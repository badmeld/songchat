There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight

I need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong tonight

It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

Another shot, before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight
Alright, alright

Put on your shades, I know you're dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Oh, it isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight

It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment, oh, baby, with you
I'm on the edge, I'm on the edge
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a momentâ€¦
I'm on the edge with you
With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, with you, with you
