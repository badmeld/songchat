Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around

Push it,
in Brooklyn.
Painted green watermelon.
That guy's ride,
Is good looking,
good looking.
He tells me that he loves me
and even though I'm real sexy
He loves his car, car, cars
He's always with his car, car, cars

So I...
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Knock it,
pump it,
wash it,
bump it.
Rub that glitter and grease,
He loves it!
He's so fine he makes her shiny,
there's more glitter and grease behind me.

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around
