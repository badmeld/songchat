Let's have some fun*
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's have some fun,
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

I wanna kiss you,
But if I do then I might miss you babe
It's comlicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy cupid
Because he want's to play
Wants to play
A love game
A love game

Hold me and love me
I just wanan touch you for a minute,
Baby three seconds is enough for my heart to quit

Let's have some fun this beat is sick,
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think to much
Just bust that kick I wanna take a ride on you disco stick

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Know the love game

I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touchin ya.
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, Yes
And now I want it bad,
Want it bad
A love game
A love game.

Hold me and love me just wanna touch you for a minute
Baby three second is enough for my haert to quit.

Let's have some fun
This beat is sick,
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick.

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Know the love game

I can't see you starin' there from across the block with a smile
On you mouth and you hand on your huh!
The story of us it starts with a boy and a girl and a huh, and
A game!
And a game,
And a game,
And a game.
A love game.

Let's play a love game.
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Know the love game

Let's have some fun,
This beat is sick I wanna
Take a ride on your disco stick.
