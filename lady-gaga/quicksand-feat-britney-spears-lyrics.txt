I still see your coat hangin' on the door,
Never let anybody put one there before.
My pillow's got your head printed on it,
Baby, of all the guys you were my favorite.

Don't ask, me why.
I just can't say goodbye.
No not, tonigth
No, I just can't say it.

'couse I'm gonna hold on,
yeah, I'm gonna hold on.
Baby, gotta keep holdin'
On to what we hand.

'couse I don't wanna move on,
So I gotta hold on.
Baby, because you and me
Are singing like quicksand.

Like quicksand Baby, because you and me
Are singing like quicksand.

Like quicksand Baby, because you and me
Are singing like quicksand.

You came along I didn't know of love.
But I know that sometimes it's just not enough.
I hear your footsteps in my corridoor,
but it is just my heart, it's puoding like before.

Wish I.
Could try.
But I just can't say goodbye...
No not, tonight.
No I just can't say it.

'couse I'm gonna hold on,
yeah, I'm gonna hold on.
Baby, gotta keep holdin'
On to what we hand.

Like quicksand 'couse a ground is breaking,
I can feel it shaking.
Wish it was that easy,
But it's not the easy

Gotta hold my hands up,
Gotta keep my head up.
Gotta keep on breathing,
Baby even if we're sinking.

Baby even if we're sinking.
