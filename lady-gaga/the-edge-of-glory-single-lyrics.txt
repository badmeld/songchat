There's no reason you and me should be alone*
 Tonight, yeah babe
 Tonight, yeah babe
 There's no reason you shouldn't take me home tonight

 I need a man who thinks it right when it's so wrong,
 Tonight yeah babe,
 Tonight yeah babe,
 Right on the limits where we know we both belong tonight

 It's time to feel the rush,
 To push the dangerous
 I'm gonna run back to, to the edge with you
 Where we can both fall in love

 I'm on the edge of glory,
 And I'm hanging on a moment of truth,
 I'm on the edge of glory,
 And I'm hanging on a moment with you,
 I'm on the edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 I'm on the edge of glory
 And I'm hanging on a moment with you
 I'm on the edge with you
 Another shot, before we kiss the other side,
 Tonight, yeah babe
 Tonight, yeah babe
 I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight
 Alright, alright
 Pull out your shade 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
 Tonight, yeah babe
 Tonight, yeah babe

 ... the burden of my name, tonight, tonight

 It's time to feel the rush
 To push the dangerous
 I'm gonna run back to, to the edge with you
 Where we can both fall in love

 I'm on the edge of glory,
 And I'm hanging on a moment of truth,
 I'm on the edge of glory,
 And I'm hanging on a moment with you,
 I'm on the edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 I'm on the edge of glory
 And I'm hanging on a moment with you
 I'm on the edge with you

 I'm on the edge with you

 I'm on the edge with you

 I'm on the edge of glory,
 And I'm hanging on a moment of truth,
 I'm on the edge of glory,
 And I'm hanging on a moment with you,
 I'm on the edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 The edge
 I'm on the edge of glory
 And I'm hanging on a moment with you
 I'm on the edge with you
