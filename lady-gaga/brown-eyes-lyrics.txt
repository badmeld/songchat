In your brown eyes I walked away
In your brown eyes I couldn't stay
In your brown eyes you'll watch her go
Then turn the record on and wonder what went wrong
What went wrong

If everything was everything but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes

In your brown eyes I was feeling low
'Cause they're brown eyes and you never know
Got some brown eyes but I saw her face
I knew that it was wrong
So baby, turn the record on, play that song

Where everything was everything but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes, brown eyes

Everything was everything but baby, it's the last show
Everything could be everything but it's time to say goodbye, so
Get your last fix and your last hit
Grab your old girl with her new tricks
Honey yeah, it's no surprise that I got lost in your brown eyes

In your brown eyes, brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes, brown, brown eyes
Got some brown eyes, brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes
