I don't speak German
But I can if you like.

[:German Chorus:]
Ich schlieben absolut klar
Es kumpent madre monster
Aus-be, aus-can-be flaugen
Begut be uske but bare

We should be absolut klar
Es kumpent uster monster
Aus-be, aus-can-be flaugen
Frauline rusha be glare

[Repeat]

I'll take you out tonight.
Do whatever you like.
SheiBe, SheiBe be mine
SheiBe be mine

Put on a show tonight
Do whatever you like 
SheiBe, SheiBe be mine
SheiBe be mine

When I'm on a mission,
I rebuke my condition,
If you're a strong female,
You don't need permission

[:Chorus:]
I, I wish that I could dance on a single prayer
I, I wish I could be strong without somebody there
I, I wish that I could dance on a single prayer
I, I wish I could be strong without the SheiBe, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Without the SheiBe yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Without the SheiBe yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Without the SheiBe yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Without the SheiBe yeah
(I don't speak German but I can if you like)
[:German Chorus:]

Love is objectified
By what men is right
SheiBe, SheiBe be mine
Won't SheiBe be mine.

But high-heeled feminists
Gone have some fun with this
Express your womankind
Fight for your rights!

When I'm on a mission,
I rebuke my condition,
If you're a strong female,
You don't need permission

[:Chorus:]
[:German Chorus:]

I, I, I, I, I, I don't speak German
I, I, I, I, I, but I can if you like.
I, I, I, I, I, I don't speak German
I, I, I, I, I, but I can if you like.

I, I wish that I could dance on a single prayer
I, I wish I could be strong with permission yeah
I, I wish that I could dance on a single prayer
I, I wish I could be strong without the SheiBe yeah!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Without the SheiBe yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Without the SheiBe yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Without the SheiBe yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Without the SheiBe yeah
