Get a little guitar on there
Twenty five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realised quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
Or whatever that means
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah!
I said hey, what's going on?
And I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution!
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
Hey, yeah, yeah
I said hey, what's going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I said hey, what's going on?
Oh, oh, oh, ooooh, do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, oh, ooooh, do, do, do, do, do, do
Twenty-five years and my life is still
