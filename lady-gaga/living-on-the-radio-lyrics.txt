I've got no friends*
I'm my own queen,
Now living on, living on the radio, that's my dream.
Stone river eyes, and a lonely heart,
Is for living on the radio, they won't tear me apart.

Ten steps and roses are on the tree.
Ten steps, and lonely nights, but you still got me.
On the road, road paved in gold.

Baby you must believe,
Baby you must be free,
Keep living on, living on the radio, that's your dream.
Baby you've got a friend,
And so many little monsters, yeah.
Living on, living on the radio.
And when there's nowhere to go,
And all your friends are gone,
And you've only got your daddy to call,
You can be all right honey,
'Cause your songs are on the radio.

'Cause the showbiz, all the caviar,
The champaign, and the sold-out shows,
You're gonna be all right honey,
'Cause your songs are on the radio.
