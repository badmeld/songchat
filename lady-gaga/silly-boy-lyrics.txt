[** feat. Rihanna:]


[Lady GaGa:]
Your callin' me more than ever now that were done*
Two keys back to my place, we were havin' no fun
But you're not ok, telling me you miss my face
I remember when you would say you hate my waist

[Rihanna:]
I said I'm not coming back, its it
You fooled me once but you cant have that ego turning
Just to bad for you, that when you had me
Didn't know what to do, shes over you

[Both Artists:]
Cause you had a good girl, good girl, girl
That's a keeper, k-k-k-k-keeper
You had a good girl, good girl but
Didn't know how to treat her, t-t-t-t-treat her (treat her)
So silly boy get out my face (my face)
Why do you like the way regrets taste?
So silly boy get out my hair my hair
(Get outta here)
No, I don't want you no more (get outta here)

[Lady GaGa:]
Silly boy (silly boy)
Why you acting silly boy?
Silly boy boy (boyboy)
Acting acting silly boy?

[Rihanna:]
You comin' with those corny lines
Cant live without me
I'll get some flowers for the day that you are buried
No, people make mistakes
But I just think your ass is fake
Only thing I want from you, is for you to (stay away)
