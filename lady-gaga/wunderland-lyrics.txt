1-2-3-4-5-6-7
No good boys ever go to heaven
Bodies move in wunderland
Open mouth kiss and we dance
I can't believe c-c-c-can't believe that I met you

Pink champagne
Mirror ball spinning round again
In this wunderland where I met you

So DJ play
Let the record spin again
In this wunderland where I met you

1-2-3-4-5-6-7
Hold your breath, count to eleven
Bodies move in wonderland
Open mouth kiss and we dance
I can't believe c-c-c-can't believe how I met you

Pink champagne
Mirror ball spinning round again
In this wunderland where I met you

So DJ play
Let the record spin again
In this wunderland where I met you

Talk to me, baby
Talk to me, baby
Talk to me, baby

Talk to me, baby
Take my hand
Talk to me, baby
I got plans
