I’m dreaming of a white Christmas
just like the ones i used to know
where the treetops glisten,
and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow

I’m dreaming of a white Christmas
with every Christmas card i write
may your days be so very merry and bright
and may all your Christmases be white

I’m dreaming of a white snow man
With a carrot nose and charcoal eyes
Oh and when he cries,
I’m gonna tell him it’s ok
Because Santa’s on his sleigh
And he’s on his way

I’m dreaming of a white Christmas
with every Christmas card i write
may your days be so very merry and bright
and may all your Christmases be white
