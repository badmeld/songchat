Ale-Alejandro

She's got both hands in her pockets
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger around you
You know that I love you, boy

Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro

I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke one cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Just let me go, Alejandro

Don't bother me, don't bother me, Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name, bye Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch,
Fernando

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke one cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro

Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Just let me go, Alejandro
