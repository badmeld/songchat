Silicone, saline, poison, inject me Baby*
I'm a free bit(ch), I'm a free bit(ch)
Some girls won't dance to the beat of the tribe
Won't walk away but she won't look back
She looks good but her boyfriend says shes a mess,
Shes a mess, shes a mess, now the girl is trash
Shes a mess (4x)
Baby Love to dance in the dark
Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby Love to dance in the dark (2x)
[2x:]

Run, Run
Her kiss is a Vampire grin moonlights away
While she is howling at him
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's A tramp
She's a tramp she's a vamp but she still does her dance
She's a tramp she's A vamp but she still kills her dance

Baby Love to dance in the dark
Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby Love to dance in the dark
[2x:]
She loves to dance in the dark
(Dance In the dark)
She Loves, she loves to dance in the dark

Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia, tell him how you feel girls
Ramsey, Lamont, White, Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your cupid
You will never fall apart Diana
You're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark

Baby Love to dance in the dark
Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby Love to dance in the dark
[2x:]
