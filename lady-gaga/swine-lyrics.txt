Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another
Not another word from you
You're just an animal
Trying to act real special
But deep down, you are just a shrew

Maybe I should have a little more
Just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you
That I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside

Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside

Swine, swine
Swine, swine
Swine!
Swine!

Be that hog
Sweat it out, you squealer
Let your body jiggle
Slap her skin-he
Love to watch her ass go wiggle
It's the feel of ecstasy

Maybe I should have a little more
Just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you
That I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside

Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside

Swine, swine
Swine, swine
Swine!

Paint your face and
Paint his face and (catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Paint her face and (catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Be a swine just (catch the beat)
For the weekend

Catch the beat
C-catch the beat
C-catch, c-c-catch the beat
C-catch the beat

Swine!
