Got my ass squeezed by sexy cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play

Hold me and love me
Just want touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds is in it for my heart to quit it

I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that thick (kick?)
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Do you want love, or you want fame
or you win the game
Through the love game
Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love, or you want fame
or you win the game

Hold me and love me
Just want touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds is in it for my heart to quit it

I can see you staring there from across the block
with a smile on your face and your hand on your c (huh!)
The story of us, it always starts the same
A boy and a girl and a (huh!) and a game
