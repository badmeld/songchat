Hold me daddy, real tight*
They'll take our picture in the spotlight.
Yeah, I know you love that limelight,
And how that DJ's spinning tonight.

Wish it wash it down,
Gonna paint the town pink.
We don't care what you think, sorry.

Everybody wants to be like us,
Filthy glamorous.
Real hot body.
Sexy ugly.
Rock like us, silly and gorgeous.

Hold your mama real tight,
She's turning colors in the black light.
Soundophobic polite,
Don't be afraid to shake that butt right.

Wish it wash it down,
Gonna paint the town pink.
We don't care what you think, sorry.

Everybody wants to be like us,
Filthy glamorous.
