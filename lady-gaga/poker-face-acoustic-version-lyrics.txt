[Lady Gaga:]
Hello, my name is Lady Gaga and this is my acoustic version of Poker Face..

I wanna hold em' like they do in Texas plays,
Fold em' let em' hit me, raise it, baby stay with me
Love game, intuition play the cards with spades to start,
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

[Chorus:]
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(He's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face

I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me 
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love, if its not rough it isn't fun......

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
I want you to know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

[Repeat Chorus:]

Woh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-woh-oh-oh-oh

I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying 
I'm just stunnin' 
With my love-glue-gunning

Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I am marvelous

So marvelous, I'm marvelous
So marvelous, so marvelous
Can't ready my, can't read my
He can't ready my Poker Face
