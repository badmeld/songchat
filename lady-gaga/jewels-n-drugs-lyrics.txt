feat. T.I., Too Short & Twista


[Verse 1: T.I.]
Still bank here, shawty, yeah you know what it is
Pockets full of number of bands and bills
Came up around that standard wheel
Was finna do a deal about 60 mill
You ain't live that life, you perputrating
You wasn't really trapping circling birds of yay
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a [?] err day
'Round my way can't get murder planned
Ain't no hoop, play dirty, man
Put some through your [?] man
Your partner won't show we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E [?] G-A-N-G, yeah wait
Yeah, pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go ahead Gaga

[Hook: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, don't want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, don't want your drugs
Don't want your jewels, don't want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I admit that my habit is expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
And you [?] the way we've acted
Keep it coming, I'm coming around like your friend now
I think you should, should up and sit down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Too Short]
Ey, everybody about that money, what she want?
I'm high as hell trying to have some fucking fun
I don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine
Trying to quit it, but I can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet event, every tragic sink in
It's good pussy in the passenger's set
My little homies hang with me cause I be passing their friends
Bitch

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs,
Play that hustle,
Smother "em,if you wanna be bad,
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle,
Smother "em,if you wanna be bad,
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family,
We know how to make that money

[Beat Break]
DJ White Shadow!

[Verse 4: Twista]
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like a [?] I can do it like a glove
I feel like a diamond, I can do it like a drug
And I want us to come so I can show that I can hit it
I can admit it, I am influenced by [?]
Trying to provoke by giving money and jewelry
In the sense of me instead of the recipe, I am a legacy
Taking it to another level [?] when I get it
Hold up
Twista be going at warp speed breaking atoms
[?] she got me creating antimatter
Smoking with me, now I gotta be [?] ready to move the club
[?] anomaly
And I'mma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably [?] business, but I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels and drugs
