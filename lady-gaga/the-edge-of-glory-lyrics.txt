There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah baby
Tonight, yeah baby
I've got no reason that you who should take me home tonight

I need a man who thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah baby
Tonight, yeah baby

Right on the limits where we know we both belong tonight
It's time to feel the rush

To push the dangerous
I'm gonna run back to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall hard in love
I'm on The Edge of Glory
and I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on The Edge of Glory
and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge

I'm on The Edge of Glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
Another shot, before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah baby
Tonight, yeah baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight
Alright, alright
Put on your shades 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames

Tonight, yeah baby
Tonight, yeah baby
It doesn't hurt if everybody knows my name tonight
Alright, alright

It's time to feel the rush
To push the dangerous
I'm gonna run back to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love
I'm on The Edge of Glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
I'm on The Edge of Glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge

The edge

I'm on The Edge of Glory

And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on The Edge of Glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
I'm on The Edge of Glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you

I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge

I'm on The Edge of Glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
With you
With you
With you
With you
I'm on the edge with you
With you
With you

I'm on the edge with you
