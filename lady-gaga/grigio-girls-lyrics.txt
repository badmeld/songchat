I was 23
She was 35
I was spiraling out
And she was so alive

A Texas girl real strong
Taught me this drunk song
So when I start to ball
She says, "Let your teardrops fall"

On the Pinot
Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold

All the Pinot
Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world

Ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Make it all make sense
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Does it all make sense?
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Make it all make sense

Sisters never pack up
We always run back, love
Seven years ago
I said you'd make it

Sonja was Joanne's friend
Tough girls on the mend
So when I'm feeling small
I toss that cork and call

On the Pinot
Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold

All the Pinot
Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world

Ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Make it all make sense
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Make it all make sense
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Does it all make sense?

So, we'll turn on a bachelorette
Dye Ashley's hair red
And then we'll have our sixth
Spice girl in this bitch

On the Pinot
Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold

All the Pinot
Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world

All the Pinot
Pinot Grigio girls
Gather 'round now
Watch your blues turn gold

All the Pinot
Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world
