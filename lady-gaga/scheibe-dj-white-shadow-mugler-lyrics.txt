I don't speak german
But I can if you like
(like like like)

Ich bin mir absolut klar
Ich trag den Namen Monster
I wish we all could be blind
It become easy (easy) out there

I'll take you out tonight
Do whatever you like
I wish I had your mind
Your dirty mind

Put on a close night
Do whatever you like
I wish I had your mind
Your dirty mind

I I I I
(oh oh oh oh oh)

I don't speak german
But I can if you like

Ich bin mir absolut klar
Ich trag den Namen Monster
I wish we all could be blind
It become easy (easy) out there
