I'm gonna Marry the Night
I won't give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
Live passionately, tonight

I'm gonna marry the dark
Gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my
Own emptiness, I'm a winner

I'm gonna Marry the Night
I'm gonna Marry the Night
I'm gonna Marry the Night

I'm gonna Marry, the Night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna Marry, the Night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

M-m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the Night
Oh m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the Night
I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the street that I love

In my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar
But I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser

I'm gonna Marry the Night
I'm gonna Marry the Night
I'm gonna Marry, the Night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna Marry, the Night

Leave nothing on these streets to explore
M-m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry

M-m-m-marry the Night
Oh m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the Night
Nothing's too cool

To take me from you
New York is not just
A tan that you'll never loose
Love is the new
Denim or black
Skeleton guns
Are wedding bells in the attic?

Get Ginger ready
Climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
'Cause that's where we make love
Come on and run
Turn the car on and run
I'm gonna Marry, the Night
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna Marry, the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explode
M-m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry

M-m-m-marry the Night
Oh m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry

M-m-m-marry the Night
Oh m-m-marry, m-m-m-marry
M-m-m-marry the Night
I'm gonna marry, marry

I'm gonna marry, marry
Come on, come on, the night
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night, (uh, I'm gonna)
The night
