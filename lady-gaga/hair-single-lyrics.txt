Whenever I'm dressed cool my parents put up a fight 
And if I'm hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night 
And in the morning I'm short of my identity 
I scream, "Mom and dad, why can't I be who I wanna be, to be?"

I just wanna be myself and I want you to love 
Me for who I am 
I just wanna be myself and I want you to know 
I am my hair

I've had enough, this is my prayer 
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair 
I've had enough, this is my prayer 
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair

I've had enough, I'm not a freak 
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on the streets 
I've had enough, enough, enough 
And this is my prayer, I swear

I'm as free as my hair 
I'm as free as my hair 
I am my hair 
I am my hair

Free as my hai-ai-air 
Hai-ai-air, hair 
Free as my hai-ai-air 
Hai-ai-air, hai-ai-air

Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights 
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite 
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance 
I've got my bangs to hide that I don't stand a chance, a chance

I just wanna be myself and I want you to love 
Me for who I am 
I just wanna be myself and I want you to know 
I am my hair

I've had enough, this is my prayer 
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair 
I've had enough, this is my prayer 
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair

I've had enough, I'm not a freak 
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on the streets 
I've had enough, enough, enough 
And this is my prayer, I swear

I'm as free as my hair 
I'm as free as my hair 
I am my hair 
I am my hair

Free as my hai-ai-air 
Hai-ai-air, hair 
Free as my hai-ai-air 
Hai-ai-air, hai-ai-airr

I just want to be free, I just want to be me 
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties 
Don't want to change and I don't want to be ashamed 
I'm the spirit of my hair, it's all the glory that I bear

I'm my hair, I am my hair 
I'm my hair, I am my hair 
I am my hair, I am my hair, I am my hair 
It's all the glory that I bear

I'm my hair, I am my hair 
It's all the glory that I bear 
I'm my hair, I am my hair 
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah

It's all the glory that I bear 
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah 
It's all the glory that I bear 
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah 

It's all the glory that I bear 
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah

I've had enough, this is my prayer 
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair 
I've had enough, this is my prayer 
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair

I've had enough, I'm not a freak 
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on the streets 
I've had enough, enough, enough 
And this is my prayer, I swear

I'm as free as my hair 
I'm as free as my hair 
I am my hair, I am my hair 

Ooh, I'm my hair, I'm my hair
