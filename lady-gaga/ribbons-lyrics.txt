I'm not bad, I just sound that way

All the girls they like their presents, like their presents
When boys wrap 'em up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
Doesn't matter if they're precious or expensive
If they're well thought out, sexed out, wrapped right
Every time, get in line and give me mine

We like black, white, big striped
Polka dotted cafe latte presents
Come in many sizes wrap it up in ribbons

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
(In ribbons)
Wrap them presents up
(In ribbons)

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
(In ribbons)
Wrap them presents up
(In ribbons)

I'm not a Hallmark card expression
Need material attention
Wrapped in ribbons riches
Simmons, silly ribbons, ribbons, ribbons

If you can't afford the best
Don't be stressed, take a rest
Get a job, do it right
It's my birthday all night

We like black, white
Big striped, famous super sizing
We don't care what you put inside it
Wrap it up in ribbons

It's the life style that I like
I'll give you yours, you'll give me mine
But don't forget to wrap them up
In pretty, pretty ribbons

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
(In ribbons)
Wrap them presents up
(In ribbons)

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
(In ribbons)
Wrap them presents up
(In ribbons)

Only difference between uptown and downtown
Is therapy and volume, therapy and volume
Not lying when I say this, there's a price to being famous
Yeah, it's therapy and volume, therapy and volume, huh

It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up, everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
(Wrap it up now)
Everybody wrap it up

(Lots of presents)
It's not complicated
(Filthy riches)
Just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up

(Wrap it up now)
Everybody wrap it up
(Got good presents)
It's not complicated

(Filthy riches)
Just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
(Wrap it up now)
Everybody wrap it up
(Wrap it up now)

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
