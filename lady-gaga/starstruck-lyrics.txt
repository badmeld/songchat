Groove slam, work it back
Filter that, baby bump that track
Groove slam, work it back
Filter that, baby bump that track

Groove slam, work it back
Space Cowboy just play that track
Gaga in the room, so starstruck
Cherry cherry cherry cherry, boom boom

Rollin' up to the club on the weekend
Stylin' out to the beat that you're freakin'
Fantasize on the track that you're tweakin'
Blow my heart up

Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Queue me up, I'm the twelve on your table
I'm so starstruck

So starstruck, baby could you blow my heart up?
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up?
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up?
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up?

Baby now that we're alone, got a request
Would you make me number one on your playlist?
Got your dirty headphones with the left side on
Wanna scratch it back and forth, back and forth, uhuh

Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Put the breakdown first
Up into the chorus to the verse, bick a bick a reverse

So starstruck, baby could you blow my heart up?
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up?
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up?
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up?

Hey, lived all my life really, really is that him?
I haven't seen here before, and she got all them big rims
It's it like cash flow, my baby don't trip
Should shawty say hand over your signature right here

Like a just a dotted line, and I'm supposed to sign
How she add it up, a fanatic and I think it's going down
She's so starstruck, the gal all stuck
I shoulda had an overdose on too many Starbucks

Ain't neva seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Stunna soon let the top back on that Chevy impala
Hummers and all that fully loaded with two ballers
What do you call that when you're shawty with two daughters?

But that's another chapter, slow lover bachelor
I don't know me, that's part of the baby actor
Complete swagger, there go the dagger
Got what she want, shawty happily ever after

I'm so starstruck, baby could you blow my heart up?
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up?
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up?
I'm so starstruck
Baby could you blow my heart up?
