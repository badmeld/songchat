Silicone, saline, poison, inject me, baby
I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch

Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won't walk away, but she won't look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess, now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark

Run, run her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights away while she's howlin' at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still kills the dance

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
In the dark, she loves to dance in the dark
In the dark, she loves, she loves to dance in the dark

Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia, tell 'em how you feel, girls
Work your blond, Benet Ramsey will haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick

You will never fall apart
Diana you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark, baby

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
