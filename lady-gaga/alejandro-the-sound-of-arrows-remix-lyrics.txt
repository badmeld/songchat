I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this
Alejandro

Oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh (oh, oh, oh)
She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she wont look at you
Won't look at you
She hides through love
A super seal
She got a halo around her finger
Around you

(Pre-)
You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to loose

()
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Just smoke one cigarette more
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But, her boyfriend's like a dad
Just like a dad
Draw those flames that burn before him

Now he's gonna find a fight
Gonna fool the dad

(Pre-)
You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to loose
