(*Lady Gaga, Fusari)


Hello everybody*
Get a ride to the west side
Kiss the girl with her tongue tied

Hello everybody
Walk it out cause you don't care
Shut down like software

Hello everybody
Take a sip for the hip hop
Fuel up at the rest stop

We're just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the faux disco scene

Retro dance freak (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats (retro, retro, freak)
Retro dance freak
Undercover the girl needs a lover

What's up everybody
Take a ride on an airplane
Take a bath in champagne

What's up everybody
Watch the girls all curtsy
For the paparazzi

Let's go everbody
It's time that we rotate
Cause it's getting real late

We're just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the faux disco scene

Retro dance freak (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats (retro, retro, freak)
Retro dance freak
Undercover the girl needs a lover

Retro dance freak (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats (retro, retro, freak)
Retro dance freak
Undercover the girl needs a lover

Retro dance freak
Singing retro dance beats
Retro dance freak
Undercover the girl she needs a lover

We are just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the faux disco scene

Retro dance freak (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats (retro, retro, freak)
Retro dance freak
Undercover the girl needs a lover

Retro dance freak (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats (retro, retro, freak)
Retro dance freak
Undercover the girl needs a lover
