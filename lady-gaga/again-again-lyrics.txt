You've gotta a lotta lotta nerve

Coming here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you, it isn't fair
Born March of '86, my birthday's coming
And if I had one wish, yeah, you'd be it

When you're 'round
I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me

Again and again, again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again, again, again, again, again
Never stop, oh

He never really saw me
Or waited when we were hooking up
Yeah, he'd a never last

Last week when I was sad
You said that you knew
My eyes change from kinda green
To kind blue, heya

When you're 'round
I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me

Again and again, again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again, again, again, again, again
Never stop, oh

They tell me if I leave him
Baby, would you be there?
'Cause maybe you could
Be m-m-mine all the t-t-time
