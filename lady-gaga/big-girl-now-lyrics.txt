[** feat. New Kids On The BlocK:]


I'm a big boy, you're a big girl now, now, now...
I'm a big girl, you're a big boy now, now, now...

Back in the day, when you were young (It was fun)
Little girl, didn't think you were the one (Now, here I come)
Your sexy walk, your sexy talk (That's what's up)
Little girl, you're clearly not the same kid from the block

I ain't that little girl no more, not no more, that's for sure
Boy, your get ass out on the floor, let's explore, let's explore

[Chorus:]
You know I like the way you move it (move it)
Girl, you're all grown up and now you're ready to let it go
Wanna be a big girl 'bout to prove it (prove it)
With a body like that, you've got a grown man ready to blow

I'm a big boy, you're a big girl now, now, now
I'm a big girl, you're a big boy now, now, now

Back in the day, when I was young (Kinda dumb)
But I always knew I'd be the one (Now, here you come)
Gonna get you wet, gonna make you sweat (Girl, I bet)
Gonna give you something you ain't never gonna forget

You ain't no little girl no more, no, that's for sure, yup, booty like oh...
Wanna work it like a big girl, let's explore
Now, drop it to the floor, baby, get more

[Repeat Chorus: (2x)]

I'm a big boy, you're a big girl now, now, now
I'm a big girl, you're a big boy now, now, now
I'm a big boy, you're a big girl now, now, now
I'm a big girl, you're a big boy now, now, now

I've been waiting too long for you to get naughty
Beat this, spank me daddy, come on touch my body

See that good things come to those who wait
Come take me on before it's too late

Oh... Baby, oh yeah, you know I like the way...

[Repeat Chorus: (2x)]

Hey, hey, hey... Hey, hey, hey...
A grown man ready to blow...
