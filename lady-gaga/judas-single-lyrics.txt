Oh oh oh oh oh*
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas

Judas, Juda, Judas, Juda
Judas, Juda, Judas, GaGa
Judas, Juda, Judas, Judas
Judas, Juda, Judas, GaGa

When he calls to me I am ready
I wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down
A king with no crown
King with no crown

I'm just a holy fool
Oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

I'm just a holy fool
Oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas

Judas, Juda, Judas, Juda
Judas, Juda, Judas, GaGa

I couldn’t love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I’ve learned love is like a brick
You can build a house or sink a dead body

I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down
A king with no crown
King with no crown

I'm just a holy fool
Oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

I'm just a holy fool
Oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

In the most Biblical sense I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense I just speak in future tense
Judas kiss me if offenced or wear ear condom next time

I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

I'm just a holy fool
Oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

I'm just a holy fool
Oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas

Judas, Juda, Judas, Juda
Judas, Juda, Judas, GaGa
