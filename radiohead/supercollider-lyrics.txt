Super collider
Dust in a moment
Particles scatter
Parting from the soup

Swimming upstream
Before the heavens crack open
Thin pixelations
Coming out from the dark

In a blue light
In a green light
In a half life
In a work light

Im a B-spin
Flip flopping
Im a pulse wave
Outstepping

I´ll put the shadows back into
The boxes

I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second

I have jettisoned my illusions
I have dislodged my depressions

And put the shadows back into
The boxes

I've seen the angels hanging over the balcony
