No Surprises Please (1995 version)
He was sick of his clock stopping
"Wind it up," that girl said sleeping next to him

The watch stopped
The battery'd run down
He started his broken sentence, "no alarms..."

The watch stopped
The battery'd run down
He started his broken sentence, "no alarms and no surprises..."

He was sick of her excuses
To not take off her dress when bleedin' in the bathroom

He was sick of his clock stopping
"wind it up"

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please..
