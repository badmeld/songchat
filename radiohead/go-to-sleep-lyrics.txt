Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body

Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body

I'm gonna go to sleep and let this wash all over me

We don't really want a monster taking over
Tip toe around, tie him down
We don't want the loonies takin' over
Tip toe around, tie him down

May pretty horses come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep and let this wash all over me
