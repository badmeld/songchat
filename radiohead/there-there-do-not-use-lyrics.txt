In Pitch Dark I Go Walking In Your Landscape.
Broken Branches Trip Me As I Speak.
Just Because You Feel It Doesn't Mean It's There.
Just Because You Feel It Doesn't Mean It's There.
There's Always A Siren
Singing You To Shipwreck.
(Don't Reach Out, Don't Reach Out)
Steer Away From These Rocks
We'd Be A Walking Disaster.
(Don't Reach Out, Don't Reach Out)
Just Because You Feel It Doesn't Mean It's There.
(There's Someone On Your Shoulder)
Just Because You Feel It Doesn't Mean It's There.
(There's Someone On Your Shoulder)
There There
Why So Green And Lonely?
Heaven Sent You To Me.
We Are Accidents
Waiting Waiting To Happen.
