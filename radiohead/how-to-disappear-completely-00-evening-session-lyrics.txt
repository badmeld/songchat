That there, that's not me, I go where I please
I walk through walls, I float down the Liffey
I'm not here, this isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here

In a little while I'll be gone
The moment's already passed, yeah, it's gone
And I'm not here, this isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here

Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes
I'm not here, this isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here
