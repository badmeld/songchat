Don't turn nasty now, the dust of hell, the pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box, the one who broke the spell

Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been around, you've been around enough
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is, I should look

The glue won't hold, the thread un-pull, uncurling with my love
The last one out of the box, the one who broke the seal

Obligations, complications
Routines and schedules,
A drug that will kill you, kill you

Little by little by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
