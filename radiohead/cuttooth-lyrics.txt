I would lead the wallpaper life
Or run away to the foreign legion
I would lead the wallpaper life
Or run away to the foreign legion

And as the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

Hold you till your arms are sore
Until you cannot feel it any more
Hold you till your arms are sore
Until you find an open door

I built you up to pull you down
Tie you to your feet, and watch you drown
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I built you up to pull you down
Tie you to the stake, and watch you crying out

I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive
I'll find another skin to wear
I'll find another skin to wear
