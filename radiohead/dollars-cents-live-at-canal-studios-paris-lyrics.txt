There are better things to talk about
Be constructive, bear witness
We can use, be constructive with your blues
Even when it's only warnings
Even when you're talking war games

Why don't you quiet down? Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down? Why don't you quiet down?

You don't live in a business world
He never goes and he never stays
We'll have goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe
It's all over, the baby's crying
It's all over, maybe I can see out of here
All over, the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over, all over, all over, all over

Quiet down
(We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence)
(And the mark and the yen and yeah, we're going to)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Crack your little souls, we're going to crack your little souls)
Why don't you quiet down?
(We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence)
And the pounds and pence and yeah, we're going to)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Crack your little souls, crack your little souls)

We are the dollars and cents
