In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches trip me as I speak
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out don't reach out)
(Don't reach out don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster

(Don't reach out don't reach out)
(Don't reach out don't reach out)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulders)
(Someone on your shoulders)

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there

(Someone on your shoulders)
(Someone on your shoulders)

There there!
Why so green and lonely?
And lonely
And lonely
Heaven sent you to me
To me
To me
We are accidents
Waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents
Waiting
Waiting to happen
