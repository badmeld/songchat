Go home and stop grinning at everyone

Go home and stop grinning at everyone

It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone
It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone

Blow into this paper bag

Take your armor off, you're not under attack
Take your armor off, you're not under attack

Come on, come on

Blow into this paper bag
Go home, stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home, stop grinning at everyone

That they were honeybees on a blade of grass
Take your armor off, you're not under attack
