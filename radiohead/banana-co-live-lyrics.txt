Oh Banana Co.
We really love you and we need you
And oh, Banana Co.
We'd really love to believe you

But everything's underground
We got to dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Oh, she said, "No go"
She said she'd like to
She's seen you
But no, no go
She knows if you die then we all do

And everything's underground
We've got to dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah
Everything's burning down
We got to put it out somehow
Yeah, yeah
