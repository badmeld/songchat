No Ripcord
Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed
You feel it till you're dry
You feel it till you've had enough
And you don't understand

No Ripcord, no ripcord
No Ripcord, no ripcord

Airplane, do I mean what I mean
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh airplane

A thousand miles an hour
The politics of power
See you don't understand

No Ripcord, no ripcord
No Ripcord, no ripcord

la la la la...

The answer to your prayers
[  ??  ]

No Ripcord, no ripcord
No Ripcord, no ripcord
