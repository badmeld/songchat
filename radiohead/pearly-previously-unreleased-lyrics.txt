How'd you get your teeth so pearly?
Dew-drop dentures, white-washed faces
She runs from the third world pearly

Vanilla
(Feel it crawl to me)
Milkshakes
(Crawl back again)

From Hard Rock
(Whatever you say)
Cafes
(Make it go away)

That's where
(I feel it crawl to me)
She got her
(Crawl back again)

Sweet tooth
(Make it go away)
For white boys
(Whatever you say)
She runs from the third world pearly

Hurts me
Darling, hurts me
Darling, use me
Darling, use me
