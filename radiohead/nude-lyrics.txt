Don't get any big ideas, they're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white and feel up with noise
But there'll be something missing

Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rail

So don't get any big ideas, they're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
