Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Snaps you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance you fucker
Dance you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love is given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman

Let me back

I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror

Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside

Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
But I'll never see 'em again
If I squeal to the cops

Stepford wives, who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers
Investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and sunday papers
City boys in first class don't know we're born little
Someone else is going to come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
I wish you'd get up
Get over, get up, get over
Turn your tape off

I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see 'em again
If I squeal to the cops

So I'm just gonna...
