Nobody Does It Better
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby you're the best

I wasn't looking but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me, the spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Sometimes I wish someone would
Nobody does it half as good as you
Why'd you have to be so good

The way that you hold me, whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running, but just keep it coming
How'd you learn to do the things you do

And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Baby, baby
Baby you're the best
Baby you're the best
Baby you're the best
Baby you're the best
