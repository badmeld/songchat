They love me like I was a brother
They protect me
Listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine
Made me happy
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

I call up my friend the good angel
But she's out with
Her ansaphone
She says that she would love to come help but
The sea would
Electrocute us all
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
(If you think that you're strong enough)
Nice dream
If you think you belong enough
If you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream

(If you think you belong enough)

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
