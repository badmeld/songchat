In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes they turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes they turn me
Sunk without a trace

The bottom of the deep
Your eyes they turn me
Turn me into phantoms
I follow you to the edge of the earth
And fall off everybody leaves

If they get the chance
And this is my chance

Eaten by worms
And we? re fishies
Picked over by the worms
And we? re fishies
We? re fishies, we? re fishies

Hit the bottom of
Hit the bottom to
Escape, escape
Hit the bottom of
Hit the bottom to
Escape, escape, escape
