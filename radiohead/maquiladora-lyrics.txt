Here it comes, here it comes
I can feel the hills exploding
Exploding gracefully
Burning up the freeway

Here it comes
Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful kids into beautiful trouble

And it seems to fall out of the sky
And come down on you
Oh baby, burn

Fast, die younger
Burns rubber
Useless rockers from England
Guitars, hard by all

Just swallow your guilt and your conscious
Blue and white birds stop and hide on the pedal
Interstate fire, walk straight down the middle

And it seems to fall out of the sky
And come down on you
Oh baby, burn
