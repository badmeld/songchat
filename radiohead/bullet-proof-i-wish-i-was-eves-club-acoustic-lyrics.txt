Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Tearing up inside of me
Everyday everyhour wish that i
Was bullet proof.

Wax me
Mould me heat the pins
And stab them in you have turned me into this
Just wish that it
Was bullet proof.

So pay me money and take a shot
Lead-fill
The hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All
Surrogate
&
Bullet proof.
