(New Order cover)


This is why events unnerve me
They find it all a different story
Notice whom four wheels are turning
Turn again and turn towards this time
All she asks the strength to hold me
Then again the same old story
World will travel oh so quickly
Travel first and towards this time

Oh I'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows It's got to be this time
Watching her, these things she said,
Times she cried, to frail to wake this time

Oh I'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows It's got to be this time
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Watching forever, forever
Watching love grow, forever
Letting me know, forever.
