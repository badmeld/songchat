Hey hey hey, hey

If they think they can tell us all of their problems
If they think we'd listen if we had a clue yeah
Well I'm gonna tell them something that's good and evil yeah
If we don't then we'll give into something far too strong
So keep strong, keep strong

Going deeper and deeper into the debt
Going deeper and deeper into depression
All the time they're making you bad boy, boy boy boy
All the time they're making you bad boy
So keep strong, keep strong

Anyone can be a millionaire
Anyone can have a big black car and a phone (Yes, yes, yes)
Cos its just as easy, they'll rot in hell
Cos its just as easy, they're all fat bastards and
Nothing at all, keep strong

Hey
Hey

Keep strong, keep strong
Yeah ooh

Hey hey hey, hey
Hey hey hey, hey
Hey hey hey, hey
Hey hey hey, hey

yeah And if you wanna be rich then you gotta be a bastard
But, but if you can't be a bastard then you might as well just sit in front of
Your television and spend the rest of your life like a fucking zombie

Keep strong, keep strong
