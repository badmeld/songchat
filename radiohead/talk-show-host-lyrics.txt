I want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon this surface for the birds
The birds, the birds

You want me?
Fucking well come and find me
I'll be waiting
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches

And nothing
Nothing
Nothing

Nothing

You want me?
Well come on and break the door down
You want me?
Fucking come on and break the door down

I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready

I'm ready
I'm ready
