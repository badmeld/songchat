I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rappin' upon my windowsill

Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up sktterbrain
Any fool can easy pick a hole
I only wish I could fall in

A moving target in a firing range
Somewhere I'm not sktterbrain
Somewhere I'm not sktterbrain
Lightning fuse, power cut, sktterbrain
