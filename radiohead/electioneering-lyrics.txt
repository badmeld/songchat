I will stop, I will stop at nothing
Say the right things when electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote

When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet, ha ha ha

Riot shields, voodoo economics
It's just business, cattle prods and the IMF
I trust I can rely on your votes

When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
