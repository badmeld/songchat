I do not understand what it is I've done wrong
Full of holes, check the pulse
Blink your eyes one for yes, two for no

I've no idea what I am talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out

Make a sound, move back home
Get an invitation with the edges sawn off

I have no idea what you are talking about
[Incomprehensible]

Has the light gone out for you
Because the light's gone for me?
It is the 21st century, it is the 21st century

You can fight it like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got scared and they put me in
They got scared and they put me in

All the lies run around my face
All the lies run around my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see, I'm alive

I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
