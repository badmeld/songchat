Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed

You're free until you drop
You're free until you've had enough
And you don't understand
No ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord

Aeroplane do I mean what I mean?
Oh it's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane

A thousand miles an hour
On politics and power
That she don't understand
No ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord

The answer to your prayers
We'll drop you anywhere
No ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no no no ripcord
Oh yeah
