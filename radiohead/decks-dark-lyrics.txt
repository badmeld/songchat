[Chorus]
And in your life, there comes a darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Are we trapped? Rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
In your darkest hour

[Verse]
But it was just a laugh, just a lie
Just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
A 10-ton head, made of wet sand
This dread still covers us
You gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
Split infinitive

[Chorus]
And in your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
It's the loudest sound you've ever heard
In your darkest hour

[Outro]
Have you had enough of me?
Have you had enough of me?
Sweet darling
Have you had enough of me?
Have you had enough of me?
Sweet darling
Sweet time
Sweet dark
Sweet dark
