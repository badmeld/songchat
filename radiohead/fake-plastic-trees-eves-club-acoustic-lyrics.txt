Her green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant in fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans to get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties but gravity always wins

And it wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling if I just turn and run

And it wears me out, it wears me out
It wears me out, it wears me out

And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted all the time, all the time
