It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long, vivid dream
The sweetest flower, fruits are hanging from the trees
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me
It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream

Just exactly as I remember, every word, every gesture
Have my heart in my mouth

Like I've fallen out of bed from a long, vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now, out of water

Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me

I fell open, I lay under at the tip I lost your number
I wanna slip over and get back under
And if you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong

If you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong

Like I've fallen out of bed from a long, vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

When at last you'll give in
When at last you'll give in

Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up, wake me up
