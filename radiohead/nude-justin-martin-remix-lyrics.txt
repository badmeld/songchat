Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint your smile
And fill the noise
There'll be something missing
Just when you found it
It's gone
Just when you feel it
You don't
It's gone forever

She stands stark naked
And she beckons you to bed
Don't go, you'll only want
To come back again

So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to Hell
For what your
Dirty mind is thinking

And now that you found it
It's gone
Now that you feel it
You don't
It's gone forever
