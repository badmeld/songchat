Appliances have gone berserk
I can't look you up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little fools

And I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses live and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe

And if I don't know [unverified]
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

â€~Cause I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses live and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe

It's too much
Too bright, too powerful
Too much
Too bright, too powerful

Too much
Too bright, too powerful
Too much
