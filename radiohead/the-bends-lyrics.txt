Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now, when I need you?

Alone on an aeroplane
Falling asleep against the window pane
My blood will thicken

I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cos I'd be scared
That there's nothing underneath

But who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?

My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends, no, no, no

Just lying in the bar
With my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend
Waiting for something to happen

I wish it was the sixties
I wish we could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish
That something would happen

Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat
In a sea of fear
And where are you?

They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole Marines
To blow me away
To blow me sky high

My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

Just lying in the bar
With my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend
Waiting for something to happen

I wish it was the sixties
I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish
That something would happen

I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race
Race, race, race

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now, when I need you?
