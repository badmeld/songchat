Did it all for you to say you never wanted me that way
Now the dogs have had their meat, I think I'll go plug in the remains
I tumble like a cloud before you burn in hell
I'll suffocate myself into your hell

When you spare a make up smile, I'm instantly your biggest fan
How was I to know that you practiced it beforehand?
I tumble like a cloud before you burn in hell
I'll suffocate myself into your hell
