Creep (Acoustic)
Recorded live on the air at KROQ, Los Angeles on July 13, 1993

When you were here before,
couldn't look you in the eye.
Just like an angel,
your skin makes me cry.
you float like a feather,
in a beautiful world.
wish I was special.
you're so very special.

and I'm a creep
I'm a wierdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts.
I want to have control.
I want a perfect body.
I want a perfect soul.
I want you to notice
when I'm not around.
You're so very special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a wierdo
What the hell am I doing here
when I don't belong here
Woah, woah

she's runnin out again
she's running out she--run--run---run runs
Run.
Whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
youre so very special
I wish I was special

but I'm a creep
I'm a wierdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
I don't belong here.
