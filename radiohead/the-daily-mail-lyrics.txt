The moonies are up on a mountain
The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture

Singing we're here to keep your prices down
Feed you to the hounds
To the Daily Mail
Together
Together

You made a pig's ear, you made a mistake
Paid off security and got through the gate
You got away with it but we lie in wait

Where's the truth? What's the use?
I'm hanging around lost and found
And when you're here, innocent
Fat chance, no plan
No regard for human life

Keep trying, you're not right
You're fast to lose, you will lose
You jumped the queue, go back again
President for life, lord of all
The flies in the sky, the beasts of the earth
The fish in the sea, you've lost command
