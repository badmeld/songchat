Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Holy roman empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us all on
You can take us all on

You and whose army?
You and your cronies

You forget so easily
You ought to know
You ought to know
Oh so sad
Oh so sad
Oh so sad
You ought to know
You ought to know
Im so sad
Im so sad
Im so sad.
