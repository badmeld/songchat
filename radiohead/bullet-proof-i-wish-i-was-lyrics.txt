Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Tearing up inside of me
Every day, every hour, just wish that I
Was bullet proof

Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this, just wish that it
Was bullet proof

So pay me money and take a shot
Lead fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles, all surrogate
And bullet proof
