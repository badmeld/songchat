In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches trip me as I speak
Just â€ cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there
Just â€ cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there

There's always a siren singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks, we'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)

Just â€ cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there
(There's someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
Just â€ cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there
(There's someone on your shoulder)
(There's someone on your shoulder)

There there

Why so green and lonely?
And lonely, and lonely
Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me

We are accidents
Waiting, waiting to happen
We are accidents
Waiting, waiting to happen
