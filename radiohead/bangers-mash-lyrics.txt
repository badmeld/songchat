You bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
You bit me, bit me and I want more

I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
It's all heading south to the Conger Hill
The bangers in the mash, the negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not

Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up
Chief of Police or Vice Chancellor
Lord and Lady blah blah, the vicar and the judge
You're all dancing to my little red book

Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
I got the poison, poison and now I want more

If you are on the top then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power, we're changing by the hour
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark the dark will stare back
Back into your soul

I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down when I go down
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall

Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
The poison, I got the poison, I got the poison now
Yeah, I got the poison
