The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love
That we all can love
That we all
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love
That we all can love
That we all

And now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know

Broken hearts, make it rain
Broken hearts, make it rain
Broken hearts, make it rain
Broken hearts, make it rain
Broken hearts, make it rain
Broken hearts, make it rain
Broken hearts, make it rain
Broken hearts, make it rain
Broken hearts, make it rain
Broken hearts

Pieces of a rag doll mankind
That we can create
That we can create
That we can

Pieces of a rag doll mankind
That we can create
That we can create

But when I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
