Don't wanna talk to me
You don't wanna say the word
You're tryin' to get off the hook
Tryin' to get off the hook

Sprawling on a pin
Hanging off a hook
Trying to get yourself away
Trying to get yourself away

There's no use dwelling on
On what might have been
Just think of all the fun
You could be having

We know the way you talk
We know what you want
We know what you want
What you really want

Take a look around
There's candles on the cake
On what might have been
Roads you should have took
Mistakes mistaken

There's no use dwelling on
No use dwelling on

It's such a beautiful day
It's such a beautiful day
Find yourself another end
Go on and get some rest

Such a beautiful day
Such a beautiful day
Go up to the mic
Go up to the mic
Go and get some rest
