Give me
Give me, give me all
I've got the poison
The poison, poison now

Standing in the hall
Kicking out the wall
It's all he'll sell
To recover [unverified]

Bangers in the mash
An eight ball is for cash
I don't give a fuck
Baby, whether or not
Whatever turns you on
Whatever gets you off

Chief of police advise chancellor
Bottling the blah blah
Take away my [unverified]
Their all dancing to my little anthem

Because you hit me
Hit me, hit me off
I've got the poison, the poison
And now I want more

If you are on top
Then it is a long drop
Stare into the law
The pyramid is power

If you are on the top
Then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark
The dark will stare back
Back into your soul

The check came through
The check came through
The check, check, check

I want to thank you
Thank you, thank you all
I'm having such a good time
A good time, I'm havin' a ball

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
When I go down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down

I'm standing in the hall
I'm kicking out my wall
Hit me, yeah get me
Yeah, get me [unverified]

Hit me, yeah get me
Yeah, get me [unverified]
I've got the poison
