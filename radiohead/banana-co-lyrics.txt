Oh, Banana Co
We really love you and we need you
And oh, Banana co
We'd really love to believe you

But everything's underground
We gotta dig it up somehow, yeah yeah

Oh, she said, "No go"
She said she'd like to, she's seen you
And oh, Banana Co
She knows if you die, then we all do

And everything's underground
We gotta dig it up somehow, yeah yeah

Everything's burnin' down
We gotta put it out somehow, yeah yeah
