The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and

Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Yeah
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
And I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around around around around around

Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me
