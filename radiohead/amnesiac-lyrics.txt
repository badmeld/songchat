Morning bell, morning bell
Light another candle
Release me, release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Coming down the chimney

Release me, release me
Yeah, release me, release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are all over the furniture

And I might as well, I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around around, around, around, around

Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
