Here it comes, here it comes
I can feel the hills exploding
Exploding gracefully
Burning up the freeway
Here it comes

Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful gets into beautiful trouble
And it seems to fall out of the sky
And come down on you
Oh baby, burn

Fast Toyota burns rubber
Useless rockers from England
Good times had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your conscience

Blue and white birds stepping hard on the pedal
Interstate five runs straight down the middle
And it seems to fall out of the sky
And come down on you
Oh baby, burn
