Transport
Motorways and tram lines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing

The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so, disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Let down
Let down
Let down

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing, falling, bouncing back

And one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction [(you know where you are)]
Hysterical and useless [(you know where you are)]
Hysterical and [(you know where you are)]

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
