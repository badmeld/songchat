The thief was drawn to the cross
To share that other’s fate
But the Jesus man says 'Not now'
'My brother not now, it’s far too late'
(Far too late)
Far too late
(Far too late)
Far too late
(Far too late)
Far too late
(Far too late)
Far too late
(Far too late)
Far too late
(Far too late)
Far too late
(Far too late)
Far too late

Do what you must
Take what you can
Steal the heart from every man
Every angry man
Every angry man
Every angry man

I am the thief
I am the thief
And you can run
Yes you can run
But I will get you yet
Yes I will
Because of you, because it’s just your pride
It's justified

I will get you yet
Cause it’s justified
I will get you yet
It’s justified
