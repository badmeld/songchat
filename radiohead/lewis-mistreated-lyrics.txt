Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of failure is thicker than you think
Don't do this
Don't jump

Changed shape to fit
In the end you just feel sick
A million love songs under anesthetic
Hey don't do this
Don't jump

Lewis, save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain
It never really matters

We never noticed, we never understood
He'd just get crushed to fit
He never even smelt out the best
It's the best, it's the best day of your life

Lewis, save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain
It never really matters
No, I swear, I swear, I swear

Oh, mistreated
A low corporate
Oh, mistreated
A low corporate
I, I don't want to talk about it
I, I don't want to talk about it
I, I don't want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I, I don't want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
