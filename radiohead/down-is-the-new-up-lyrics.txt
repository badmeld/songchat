Get yourself together
Let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath
Pour yourself a drink

Nothing's gonna happen without warning
Down is the new up
What if I just flip-flopped?
Down is the new up, is the new up

Won't you be my girl
Won't you be my girl
Your services are not required
Your future's bleak, you're so last week

Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform an Orwellian flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort

Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flopped?
Down is the new up, is the new up

You crawled off and left us
You bastard
You bastard

Caught on Candid Camera
The chink in your armor
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on, pass it down
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town

You crawled off and left us
Crawled off and left us
You bastard
