The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends

He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I liked
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice

But now I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why I feel so skinned alive
Don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why I feel so skinned alive

My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smart-ass but we all like stars
That wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
And he strangled and he crumbled and he giggled a little
Your death in your coscience

But now I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why I feel so skinned alive
