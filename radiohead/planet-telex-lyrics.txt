You can force it
But it will not come
You can taste it
But it will not form

You can crush it
But it's always here
You can crush it
But it's always near

Chasing you home saying
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

You can force it
But it will stay stung
You can crush it
As dry as a bone

You can walk it home
Straight from school
You can kiss it
You can break all the rules, all the rules

But still
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken

Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
