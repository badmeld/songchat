Who's in a bunker?
Who's in a bunker?
Women and children first
And the children first
And the children

Laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow till I burst
Until I burst
Until I

Who's in a bunker?
Who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much
I haven't seen enough
You haven't seen it

I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first
And children first
And children

Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time

Ice age coming
Ice age coming
Let me hear both sides
Let me hear both sides
Let me hear both

Ice age coming
Ice age coming
Throw him on that fire
Throw him on that fire
Throw him on

Now we're not scaremongering
This is really happening
Happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening
Happening

Mobiles skwirking
Mobiles chirping
Take the money run
Take the money and run
Take the money

Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time

Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
