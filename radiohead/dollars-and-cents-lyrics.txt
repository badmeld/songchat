There are better things
To talk about
Be constructive

Bear witness
We can use
Be constructive
With your blues

Even when he turned
The water blue
Even when he turned
The water blue

Oh won't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Quiet down!

[Incomprehensible] the neighborhood
Sing songs and you never stay
[Incomprehensible] the neighborhood
Livin' in towns if I could stand it babe

It's all over the streets at night
It's all over the streets
Oh let me out of here
It's all over the streets at night
It's all over the streets
Oh let me out of here
All over, all over

 (Why don't you quiet down?)
We are the Dollars and Cents
And the Pounds and Pence
And the Mark and the Yen
(Why don't you quiet down?)
In the end we're gonna crack your little skull
Crack your little skull

 (Why don't you quiet down?)
We are the Dollars and Cents
And the Pounds and Pence
And the Mark and the Yen, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little skull
Crack your little skull

We are the Dollars and Cents
[Incomprehensible]
