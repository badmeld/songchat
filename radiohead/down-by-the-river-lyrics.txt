Be on my side
I'll be on your side
There is no reason
For you to hide
It's so hard for me
Staying here all alone
When you could be
Taking me for a ride

You could drag me
Over the rainbow
Take me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead

You take my hand
I'll take your hand, baby
And together we may get away
'Cause this much madness
Is too much sorrow
It's impossible
To make it today

She could drag me
Over the rainbow
Take me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead

Be on my side
I'll be on your side
There is no reason
For you to hide
It's so hard for me
Staying here all alone
When you could be
Taking me for a ride.

She could drag me
Over the rainbow,
Take me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river,
I shot my baby
Down by the river,
Dead
