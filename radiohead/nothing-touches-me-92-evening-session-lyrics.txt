Nothing touches me man
These walls are three feet thick
Wouldn't take one of them little drills to get through
I try to make her listen
When i turn away she's split
I try to make her listen
When i turn away she's split
She went...
Nothing touches me
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me man
No matter how you split
Sticks and stones can get through bones
So i've given up looking out of it
I try to make her listen
When i turn away she's split
I try to make her listen
When i turn away shes split
She went...
Nothing touches me now
Laugh if you can, at me now
