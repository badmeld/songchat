trying to sing but it doesn t come off that well
trying to build a wall that is high enough
so we re boiling over
oh we re boiling over

trying to see your eyes, trying to sing his songs
trying to run but he follows you up a hill
so we re boiling over
oh boiling over
your love owns
your love owns

no more conversation
no more conversation
you should ve took me out when you had a chance
you should ve took me out when you had a chance
i run to nobody
?
don t turn away
don t turn away
?

we re really lonesome
we re turning away
