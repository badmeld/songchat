Morning bell, the morning bell
Not another encounter
Release me, release me

You can keep the furniture
Bump on the head
Howling down the chimney

Release me, release me, yeah
Release me, release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?

Close your eyes, you're all with us
The furniture, I might as well
I might as well

Sleepy jack, the fire drill
Round and round, and round, and round
And round, and round

Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

Release me, release me
Release me, release me
