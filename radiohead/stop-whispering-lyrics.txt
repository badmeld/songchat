And the wise men say, "I don't want to hear your voice"
And the thin men say, "I don't want to hear your voice"
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

And my mother say, "We spit on your son some more"
And the buildings say, "We spit on your face some more"
And the feeling is that there's something wrong
'Cause I can't find the words, and I can't find the songs

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

Dear sir, I have a complaint
Dear sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is
Doesn't matter anyway
Doesn't matter anyway

Stop whispering, stop whispering
Stop whispering, stop whispering
Stop, stop
