And the wise man say, "I don't want to hear your voice"
And the thin man say, "I don't want to hear your voice"
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

And the mother say, "We spit on your son some more"
And the buildings say, "We spit on your face some more"
And the feeling is that there's something wrong
Because I can't find the words and I can't find the songs

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is
Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is

It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway

Stop whispering
Stop whispering
Stop whispering
Stop whispering, start shouting
