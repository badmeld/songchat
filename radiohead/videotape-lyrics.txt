When I'm at the pearly gates
This will be on my videotape, my videotape
Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me

This is one for the good days
And I have it all here in red, blue, green
In red, blue, green

You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape, on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape

This is my way of saying goodbye
â€~Cause I can't do it face to face
I'm talking to you before

No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day I've ever seen
