The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Yeah

Release me
Release me

Where'd you park your car?
Where'd you park the car?
The clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well

Sleepy jack, the fire drill
Round and round and round and round
And round and round and round
Round

Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

I wanted to tell you but you never listened
[Inaudible]
I wanted to tell you but you never listened
[Inaudible]
Walking, walking walking walking
Walking, walking walking walking
Walking, walking walking walking
Walking, walking walking

The lights are on but nobody's home
And nobody wants to be [inaudible]
Everyone wants to be your friend
And nobody wants to be [inaudible]
Walking, walking, walking walking walking
Walking, walking walking walking
Walking, walking walking walking
Walking, walking walking

The lights are on but nobody's home
And nobody wants to be [inaudible]
Everyone wants to be your friend
Nobody wants to be [inaudible]
Just walking, walking, walking walking walking
Walking, walking walking walking
Walking, walking walking walking
Walking, walking walking
