In my mind
And nailed into my hands
All the time
Killing what I fed

And everything I touch turns to stone
(All wrapped up in crinoline, all wrapped up in sugar-coated)
And everything I touch turns to stone
(All wrapped up in crinoline, all wrapped up in sugar-coated)

I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack up

And everything I touch turns to stone
(All wrapped up in crinoline, all wrapped up in sugar-coated)
And everything I touch turns to stone
(All wrapped up in crinoline, all wrapped up in sugar-coated)
