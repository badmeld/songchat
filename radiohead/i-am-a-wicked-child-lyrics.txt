Mother Mary come to me
For I am a wicked child
I've sinned and I am so confused
And I am a wicked child
I am a wicked child

I am the Devil's son
And I wish I could be good
I walk the crooked mile
Yet I wish I could be good
I wish I could be good

If I could've kept on the straight and narrow
If I could've kept on the straight and narrow
But God broke your heart
God broke your heart

Now I wake up in the night
He's tugging at my arms and legs
Like I was a marionette
Send baby Jesus
To radiate his lie
To radiate his lie
