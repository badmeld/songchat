Reckoner, you can't take it with you
Disavow the pleasure

You were not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak his name
Dedicated to all you, all your needs

Because we separate
It ripples our reflections
Because we separate
It ripples our reflections

Reckoner
Dedicated to all you, all your needs
