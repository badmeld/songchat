You can keep what you want
I want none of this
They're just bad memories
I don't want

Am I sunshine
You can pack it all up
And be gone
And be gone

If it matters to you
You can sell it all out
If the price feels right
I won't judge

If you get off your knees
You'll be out on a breeze
Take a lesson from me
Don't get stuck on a dream
