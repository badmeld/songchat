They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy

Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream

I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her answerphone
She says that she would love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all

Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream

Nice dream
(If you think that you're strong enough)
Nice dream
(If you think you belong enough)
Nice dream
(If you think that you're strong enough)
Nice dream
(If you think you belong enough)

(Now come on, now come on)
(Now come on, now come on)

Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
