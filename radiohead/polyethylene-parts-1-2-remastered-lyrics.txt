Go!

Tears of joy now scare ourselves of all that you want to be
Just got paid and now you're going, how long should you please
If I get scared I'll just call you
And I miss your glow as I unsettle
Oh, and I'll always feel, I will always feel

Right, one, two, three, four

So sell your suit and tie and come and live with me
Leukemia schizophrenia polyethylene
There is no significant risk to your health
She used to be beautiful once as well

Plastic bag, middle class, polyethylene
Decaffeinate, unleaded, keep all surfaces clean
If you don't believe me, sell your soul
If you don't get into it, no one will
