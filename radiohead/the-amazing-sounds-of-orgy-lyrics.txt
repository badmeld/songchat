I want to see you smile again
Like diamonds in the dust
The amazing sound of the killing hordes
The day the banks collapsed on us
Cease this endless chattering
Like everything is fine
When sorry is not good enough
Sit in the back while no-one drives

I'm so glad
So glad
You're mine

I'm so glad
So glad
You're mine

I'm so glad
So glad
You're mine

I'm so glad
So glad
You're mine
