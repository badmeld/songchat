You bite through the big wall
The big wall bites back
You just sit there and sulk
Sit there and bawl

You are so pretty
When you're on your knees
Disinfected
And eager to please

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul

And when the loving comes
And we've already gone
Just like your dad
You'll never change

Each time it comes
It eats me alive
I try to behave
But it eats me alive

So I declare
A holiday
Fall asleep
Drift away

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul

And when the loving comes
And we've already gone
Just like your dad
You'll never change

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul

And when the loving comes
And we've already gone
Just like your dad
You'll never change
