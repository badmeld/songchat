Funny how to drive your stupid car
Funny how 'cause I never get that far

And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gear, I cannot see the road

You got concrete eyes and I cannot see your face
And I failed in life 'cause you crushed me with your hands

And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gear, I cannot see the road
