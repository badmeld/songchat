I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light
Coming home

I used to think
I used to think
There is no future left at all
I used to think

Open up, begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all

What would I do?
What would I do
If I did not have you?

Start again and let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back

[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]

I think we should stop
