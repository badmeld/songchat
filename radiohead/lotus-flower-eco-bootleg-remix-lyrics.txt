I would shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want

I would shrink and I would disappear
I would slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I'll set you free

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I'll set you free

Slowly we unfurl as lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
Listen to your heart

We would shrink and then be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I'll set you free

'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Put this flower into my room

Slowly we unfurl as lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
Listen to your heart
